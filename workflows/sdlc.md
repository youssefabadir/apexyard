# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

How features move from idea to production.

---

## Overview

```
Planning --> Design --> Build --> Review --> QA --> Deploy --> Monitor
```

---

## Phase 1: Planning

> **Primary role**: [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) · **Supporting**: [Product Manager](../roles/product/product-manager.md), [Head of Engineering](../roles/engineering/head-of-engineering.md) · **Trigger**: new feature enters the sprint with an approved PRD
>
> Read the Tech Lead role file and adopt it before starting this phase. See [`.claude/rules/role-triggers.md`](../.claude/rules/role-triggers.md) for the full activation protocol.

### Entry Criteria

- Approved PRD from Product
- Design review complete (if UI involved)
- Priority assigned

### Activities

| Activity | Owner | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Review PRD | Tech Lead | Clarified requirements |
| Technical spike (if needed) | Engineer | Proof of concept |
| Effort estimation | Tech Lead + Team | Time estimate |
| Sprint planning | Tech Lead | Tasks assigned |

### Exit Criteria

- Requirements understood
- Estimate provided to Product
- Tickets created and prioritized
- Work scheduled in sprint/cycle

> **Sidebar — when to file a `/spike` instead of a `/feature`.** If you can answer the technical question through reasoning alone (will library X work, does this approach scale, does this UX make sense), feel free to draft the feature directly. If you genuinely don't know, file a `[Spike]` first via `/spike` — a 1-3 day, hypothesis-driven, throw-away-by-default ticket. The spike's output is the answer, not shippable code; once the answer is in, run `/spike-close --promote` (file a fresh `[Feature]` for production-shaped delivery) or `/spike-close --discard` (write a memo to `docs/spike-memos/<slug>.md` so future-us doesn't re-explore the same ground). Spike PRs are exempt from the AgDR + 80% coverage gates; code review (Rex) and the security auditor still apply. See `.claude/rules/workflow-gates.md` § Spike work and `templates/tickets/spike.md`.

---

## Phase 1.5: Journey Preview (optional, recommended for UI-heavy features)

> **Primary role**: [UX Designer](../roles/design/ux-designer.md) · **Supporting**: [Product Manager](../roles/product/product-manager.md) (PRD source), [UI Designer](../roles/design/ui-designer.md) (visual review) · **Skill**: `/journey`
>
> Slots between an approved PRD and the tech-design phase. Optional — skip for tiny features and pure-backend changes; use it when the feature has a multi-page user flow that will benefit from a "preview before build" check.

A PRD describes a feature in prose. A tech design describes the architecture. Neither answers *"what does the flow actually look like?"* — and that's where logic gaps hide (missing empty states, ambiguous back-navigation, unhandled error transitions). The `/journey` skill closes that gap by emitting a single self-contained HTML file mapping the user journey as clickable boxes (each opening a modal with the page's content).

```
/journey checkout-v2 --from-prd projects/example-app/prds/checkout.md
```

Output: `projects/<name>/journeys/<feature-slug>.html` (preview) + `<feature-slug>.yaml` (source of truth). The HTML opens in any browser, shares as an attachment, and renders without a build step.

### Entry / exit

- **Entry**: PRD approved, multi-page flow involved.
- **Exit**: stakeholders have reviewed the journey HTML, missing states / transitions filed back into the PRD or a backlog item, journey YAML committed alongside the PRD.

Skill reference: `.claude/skills/journey/SKILL.md`. Rendering decision rationale: `docs/agdr/AgDR-0016-journey-html-rendering.md`.

---

## Phase 2: Technical Design

> **Primary role**: [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) · **Escalation**: [Head of Engineering](../roles/engineering/head-of-engineering.md) (architecture review) · **Supporting**: [UX Designer](../roles/design/ux-designer.md), [UI Designer](../roles/design/ui-designer.md) (if UI involved)

### Entry Criteria

- Feature in sprint
- Requirements clear
- Journey preview reviewed (if Phase 1.5 ran)

### Activities

| Activity | Owner | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Write technical design | Tech Lead / Senior Engineer | Design document |
| Architecture review | Head of Engineering (if needed) | Approval |
| Break into tasks | Tech Lead | Task list with estimates |
| Identify risks | Tech Lead | Risk register |

> **"Have we decided this before?"** Before drafting a design, run `/agdr search <term>` (or `/agdr browse --category architecture`) to scan the portfolio's existing Agent Decision Records. The skill walks every managed project and the apexyard fork itself, so prior calls on auth, data layers, or vendor choices surface in seconds rather than getting silently re-litigated.

### Exit Criteria

- Technical design approved
- Tasks created and assigned
- Risks documented

### When Architecture Review Required

- New service or bounded context
- New external integration
- New technology
- Major data model changes
- Performance-critical features

---

## Phase 3: Build

> **Primary roles**: [Backend Engineer](../roles/engineering/backend-engineer.md), [Frontend Engineer](../roles/engineering/frontend-engineer.md) · **Coordinator**: [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) · **Trigger**: technical design approved, tasks assigned
>
> The engineer implementing the task activates the matching role. Cross-stack tickets may chain Backend → Frontend (or vice-versa) via an explicit handoff.

### Entry Criteria

- Technical design approved
- Tasks assigned
- Environment ready

### Pre-Build Gate (MANDATORY)

DO NOT START CODING until these exist in your ticket tracker:

| Requirement | How to Verify |
|-------------|---------------|
| Parent epic/feature ticket exists | Ticket with PRD link |
| User story tickets created | Sub-issues under parent |
| Each story has acceptance criteria | Checkboxes in description |
| Technical tasks broken down | Sub-issues or checklist |

### One Ticket at a Time (MANDATORY)

Work on ONE ticket at a time. Complete it fully before starting the next.

```
WRONG:
  Start #6 --> Start #7 --> Start #8 --> PR with all 3

RIGHT:
  Start #6 --> PR --> Review --> QA --> Done
  Start #7 --> PR --> Review --> QA --> Done
  Start #8 --> PR --> Review --> QA --> Done
```

### Development Flow

```
1. Create branch from main
   git checkout -b feature/TICKET-ID-description

2. Implement in small commits
   - Follow architecture principles
   - Follow coding conventions
   - Write tests as you go

3. Keep branch updated
   git rebase main regularly

4. Self-review before PR
   - Run lint/format
   - Run tests locally
   - Review own diff

5. Create PR with description
   - What: Summary of changes
   - Why: Link to ticket
   - How: Technical approach
   - Testing: How to verify
```

> **Sidebar — when to invoke `/debug` (and when NOT to).** The `/debug` skill is for bugs that **resisted naïve fix attempts**, not every bug. Three tiers, matched to bug class:
>
> | Class | Workflow |
> |---|---|
> | **Simple bug** — clear repro, obvious cause, one-line fix | `/bug` → fix → PR. **No `/debug`.** The cost of hypothesis-tree ceremony exceeds the fix cost. |
> | **Resistant bug** — naïve fix didn't hold OR cause unclear after grep + Read | `/bug` → **`/debug`** → fix → PR. Forces architecture-first reading + evidence-before-fix. Prevents shotgun debugging. |
> | **Sustained mystery** — multi-session archaeology, performance puzzle, regression hunt, incident retro | `/investigation` (live-doc workflow) — different skill entirely. Days of effort, cross-session continuity matters. See `.claude/skills/investigation/SKILL.md`. |
>
> Self-check before `/debug`: have I tried the obvious fix? Did it work? If NO → `/debug`. If didn't try yet → try the obvious thing first. Same shape as `/spike` from Phase 1 — file when you genuinely don't know; just code when you do.

### Exit Criteria

- Code complete
- Tests written and passing
- PR created

### Sub-Workflow: Database Migrations

> **Primary role**: [Data Engineer](../roles/data/data-engineer.md) / [Backend Engineer](../roles/engineering/backend-engineer.md) · **Supporting**: [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) (approve blast-radius), [SRE](../roles/engineering/sre.md) (rollback + observability) · **Gate hook**: `require-migration-ticket.sh` · **Skill**: `/migration`

Database migrations (schema / data / SQL / ORM-generated) are a distinct class of Build-phase work. High blast radius — data loss, downtime, lock contention, cross-service coordination — so they get a dedicated ticket + AgDR pair, and edits to migration files are gated until both exist.

Flow:

```
/migration  →  creates labelled ticket + migration AgDR
   │
   └─► /start-ticket <new-ticket>  → activates the migration ticket for this session
          │
          └─► Edit migration files  → require-migration-ticket.sh verifies:
                                        - active ticket has `migration` label
                                        - ticket body references the AgDR
                                        - issue is OPEN
                 │
                 └─► Dev smoke     (local command / test case)
                         │
                         └─► Staging verify  (apply + assert + rollback-tested)
                                 │
                                 └─► Prod apply  (rollback runbook ready, dashboards armed)
                                         │
                                         └─► QA / Monitor phases (per the main SDLC)
```

Rollback readiness is checked at the migration-ticket-creation stage, not at PR review — the AgDR forces the author to articulate rollback steps + a tested-against environment before the feature work begins. A migration that only articulates rollback post-hoc during PR review is already too late.

See `.claude/rules/workflow-gates.md` § "Migration Gate (3a)" for the mechanical check, and `.claude/skills/migration/SKILL.md` for the skill's process.

## Phase 4: Code Review

> **Primary role**: [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) · **Automated reviewer**: Code Reviewer agent (Rex) via `/code-review` · **Security gate** (if PR touches auth / crypto / secrets / user data): [Security Auditor](../roles/security/security-auditor.md) · **Design gate** (if PR touches UI): [UI Designer](../roles/design/ui-designer.md)
>
> Rex reviews every commit automatically. Human reviewers (Tech Lead, Security Auditor, UI Designer) activate on the triggers above. All reviews must match the commit SHA being merged.

### Entry Criteria

- PR submitted
- CI checks passing
- Self-review done

### Activities

| Activity | Owner | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Code review | Tech Lead / Peer | Feedback |
| Address feedback | Engineer | Updated PR |
| Design review | Design (if UI) | Approval |
| Approve PR | Reviewer | Merge ready |

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Follows architecture principles
- [ ] Follows coding conventions
- [ ] Tests adequate and passing
- [ ] No security issues
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Exit Criteria

- Code review approved
- Design review passed (if applicable)
- All CI checks green

---

## Phase 5: QA Verification (MANDATORY)

> **Primary role**: [QA Engineer](../roles/engineering/qa-engineer.md) · **Trigger**: merged PR → ticket moves to `qa` label (NOT auto-closed) · **Handoff from**: [Backend](../roles/engineering/backend-engineer.md) / [Frontend Engineer](../roles/engineering/frontend-engineer.md) (testable build on staging) · **Handoff to**: [Product Manager](../roles/product/product-manager.md) (AC sign-off) → Done
>
> This is the **mandatory gate** — merged code is never Done until the QA Engineer has verified every acceptance criterion. Auto-closing via `Closes #XX` is intentionally overridden with `Refs #XX` + the `qa` label when QA verification is required.

### Entry Criteria

- PR approved and merged
- Feature deployed to staging (or runnable locally)

### QA Gate

Tickets CANNOT move to Done without QA verification.

```
In Progress --> In Review --> QA --> Done
                               ^
                         MANDATORY STOP
                         QA must verify
```

### Activities

| Activity | Owner | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Verify acceptance criteria | QA Engineer | Checklist complete |
| Test edge cases | QA Engineer | Bug reports (if any) |
| Regression check | QA Engineer | No regressions |
| Sign-off | QA Engineer | Approval to close |

### If QA Finds Issues

1. QA creates bug ticket linked to original
2. Original ticket stays in QA state
3. Engineer fixes bug in new PR
4. Re-run QA verification
5. Only move to Done when QA passes

---

## Phase 6: Deploy

> **Primary role**: [Platform Engineer](../roles/engineering/platform-engineer.md) · **Support**: [SRE](../roles/engineering/sre.md) (runbook + rollback plan) · **Trigger**: QA sign-off complete, staging validated

### Entry Criteria

- QA sign-off
- Security review (if required)

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Rollback plan ready
- [ ] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Team aware

### Exit Criteria

- Smoke tests passing
- No errors in monitoring

---

## Phase 7: Monitor

> **Primary role**: [SRE](../roles/engineering/sre.md) · **Escalation**: [Head of Engineering](../roles/engineering/head-of-engineering.md) on sustained incident · **Trigger**: deployment to production, first 24-48h watch window

### Entry Criteria

- Deployed to production

### Post-Launch

- Monitor for 24-48 hours
- Gradual rollout if feature-flagged
- Collect metrics for success criteria
- Address issues immediately

---

## Timelines

| Feature Size | Design | Build | Review & Test | Total |
|--------------|--------|-------|---------------|-------|
| Small (1-2 days) | 0.5 day | 1-2 days | 0.5 day | 2-3 days |
| Medium (3-5 days) | 1 day | 3-5 days | 1-2 days | 5-8 days |
| Large (1-2 weeks) | 2-3 days | 5-10 days | 2-3 days | 2-3 weeks |
| XL (2+ weeks) | 1 week | 2+ weeks | 1 week | 4+ weeks |

---

## Roles Summary

Every phase has a primary role that activates automatically when the phase starts. Full trigger table: [`.claude/rules/role-triggers.md`](../.claude/rules/role-triggers.md). When you activate, hand off, or exit a phase's role, print the single-line marker from [`.claude/rules/role-triggers.md`](../.claude/rules/role-triggers.md) § "How to signal activation" (e.g. `▸ Activating Hisham (Tech Lead) for #42 (trigger: planning phase)`) so operators can see the phase transition in the conversation.

| Phase | Primary role | Supporting roles |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| Planning | [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) | [Product Manager](../roles/product/product-manager.md), Engineers |
| Technical Design | [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) | [Head of Engineering](../roles/engineering/head-of-engineering.md) (escalation), [UX Designer](../roles/design/ux-designer.md) / [UI Designer](../roles/design/ui-designer.md) |
| Build | [Backend Engineer](../roles/engineering/backend-engineer.md) / [Frontend Engineer](../roles/engineering/frontend-engineer.md) | [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) |
| Code Review | [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) + Rex | [Security Auditor](../roles/security/security-auditor.md) (if auth), [UI Designer](../roles/design/ui-designer.md) (if UI) |
| QA | [QA Engineer](../roles/engineering/qa-engineer.md) | Engineers (bug fixes) |
| Deploy | [Platform Engineer](../roles/engineering/platform-engineer.md) | [SRE](../roles/engineering/sre.md) |
| Monitor | [SRE](../roles/engineering/sre.md) | [Head of Engineering](../roles/engineering/head-of-engineering.md) (escalation) |
