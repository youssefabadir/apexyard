# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

How features move from idea to production.

---

## Overview

```
Planning --> Design --> Build --> Review --> QA --> Deploy --> Monitor
```

---

## Phase 1: Planning

> **Primary role**: [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) · **Supporting**: [Product Manager](../roles/product/product-manager.md), [Head of Engineering](../roles/engineering/head-of-engineering.md) · **Trigger**: new feature enters the sprint with an approved PRD
>
> Read the Tech Lead role file and adopt it before starting this phase. See [`.claude/rules/role-triggers.md`](../.claude/rules/role-triggers.md) for the full activation protocol.

### Entry Criteria
- Approved PRD from Product
- Design review complete (if UI involved)
- Priority assigned

### Activities

| Activity | Owner | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Review PRD | Tech Lead | Clarified requirements |
| Technical spike (if needed) | Engineer | Proof of concept |
| Effort estimation | Tech Lead + Team | Time estimate |
| Sprint planning | Tech Lead | Tasks assigned |

### Exit Criteria
- Requirements understood
- Estimate provided to Product
- Tickets created and prioritized
- Work scheduled in sprint/cycle

---

## Phase 2: Technical Design

> **Primary role**: [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) · **Escalation**: [Head of Engineering](../roles/engineering/head-of-engineering.md) (architecture review) · **Supporting**: [UX Designer](../roles/design/ux-designer.md), [UI Designer](../roles/design/ui-designer.md) (if UI involved)

### Entry Criteria
- Feature in sprint
- Requirements clear

### Activities

| Activity | Owner | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Write technical design | Tech Lead / Senior Engineer | Design document |
| Architecture review | Head of Engineering (if needed) | Approval |
| Break into tasks | Tech Lead | Task list with estimates |
| Identify risks | Tech Lead | Risk register |

### Exit Criteria
- Technical design approved
- Tasks created and assigned
- Risks documented

### When Architecture Review Required
- New service or bounded context
- New external integration
- New technology
- Major data model changes
- Performance-critical features

---

## Phase 3: Build

> **Primary roles**: [Backend Engineer](../roles/engineering/backend-engineer.md), [Frontend Engineer](../roles/engineering/frontend-engineer.md) · **Coordinator**: [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) · **Trigger**: technical design approved, tasks assigned
>
> The engineer implementing the task activates the matching role. Cross-stack tickets may chain Backend → Frontend (or vice-versa) via an explicit handoff.

### Entry Criteria
- Technical design approved
- Tasks assigned
- Environment ready

### Pre-Build Gate (MANDATORY)

DO NOT START CODING until these exist in your ticket tracker:

| Requirement | How to Verify |
|-------------|---------------|
| Parent epic/feature ticket exists | Ticket with PRD link |
| User story tickets created | Sub-issues under parent |
| Each story has acceptance criteria | Checkboxes in description |
| Technical tasks broken down | Sub-issues or checklist |

### One Ticket at a Time (MANDATORY)

Work on ONE ticket at a time. Complete it fully before starting the next.

```
WRONG:
  Start #6 --> Start #7 --> Start #8 --> PR with all 3

RIGHT:
  Start #6 --> PR --> Review --> QA --> Done
  Start #7 --> PR --> Review --> QA --> Done
  Start #8 --> PR --> Review --> QA --> Done
```

### Development Flow

```
1. Create branch from main
   git checkout -b feature/TICKET-ID-description

2. Implement in small commits
   - Follow architecture principles
   - Follow coding conventions
   - Write tests as you go

3. Keep branch updated
   git rebase main regularly

4. Self-review before PR
   - Run lint/format
   - Run tests locally
   - Review own diff

5. Create PR with description
   - What: Summary of changes
   - Why: Link to ticket
   - How: Technical approach
   - Testing: How to verify
```

### Exit Criteria
- Code complete
- Tests written and passing
- PR created

---

## Phase 4: Code Review

> **Primary role**: [Tech Lead](../roles/engineering/tech-lead.md) · **Automated reviewer**: Code Reviewer agent (Rex) via `/code-review` · **Security gate** (if PR touches auth / crypto / secrets / user data): [Security Auditor](../roles/security/security-auditor.md) · **Design gate** (if PR touches UI): [UI Designer](../roles/design/ui-designer.md)
>
> Rex reviews every commit automatically. Human reviewers (Tech Lead, Security Auditor, UI Designer) activate on the triggers above. All reviews must match the commit SHA being merged.

### Entry Criteria
- PR submitted
- CI checks passing
- Self-review done

### Activities

| Activity | Owner | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Code review | Tech Lead / Peer | Feedback |
| Address feedback | Engineer | Updated PR |
| Design review | Design (if UI) | Approval |
| Approve PR | Reviewer | Merge ready |

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Follows architecture principles
- [ ] Follows coding conventions
- [ ] Tests adequate and passing
- [ ] No security issues
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Exit Criteria
- Code review approved
- Design review passed (if applicable)
- All CI checks green

---

## Phase 5: QA Verification (MANDATORY)

> **Primary role**: [QA Engineer](../roles/engineering/qa-engineer.md) · **Trigger**: merged PR → ticket moves to `qa` label (NOT auto-closed) · **Handoff from**: [Backend](../roles/engineering/backend-engineer.md) / [Frontend Engineer](../roles/engineering/frontend-engineer.md) (testable build on staging) · **Handoff to**: [Product Manager](../roles/product/product-manager.md) (AC sign-off) → Done
>
> This is the **mandatory gate** — merged code is never Done until the QA Engineer has verified every acceptance criterion. Auto-closing via `Closes #XX` is intentionally overridden with `Refs #XX` + the `qa` label when QA verification is required.

### Entry Criteria
- PR approved and merged
- Feature deployed to staging (or runnable locally)

### QA Gate

Tickets CANNOT move to Done without QA verification.

```
In Progress --> In Review --> QA --> Done
                               ^
                         MANDATORY STOP
                         QA must verify
```

### Activities

| Activity | Owner | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Verify acceptance criteria | QA Engineer | Checklist complete |
| Test edge cases | QA Engineer | Bug reports (if any) |
| Regression check | QA Engineer | No regressions |
| Sign-off | QA Engineer | Approval to close |

### If QA Finds Issues
1. QA creates bug ticket linked to original
2. Original ticket stays in QA state
3. Engineer fixes bug in new PR
4. Re-run QA verification
5. Only move to Done when QA passes

---

## Phase 6: Deploy

> **Primary role**: [Platform Engineer](../roles/engineering/platform-engineer.md) · **Support**: [SRE](../roles/engineering/sre.md) (runbook + rollback plan) · **Trigger**: QA sign-off complete, staging validated

### Entry Criteria
- Tests passed
- QA sign-off
- Security review (if required)

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Staging tested
- [ ] Feature flags configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Rollback plan ready
- [ ] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Team aware

### Exit Criteria
- Successfully deployed to production
- Smoke tests passing
- No errors in monitoring

---

## Phase 7: Monitor

> **Primary role**: [SRE](../roles/engineering/sre.md) · **Escalation**: [Head of Engineering](../roles/engineering/head-of-engineering.md) on sustained incident · **Trigger**: deployment to production, first 24-48h watch window

### Entry Criteria
- Deployed to production

### Post-Launch
- Monitor for 24-48 hours
- Gradual rollout if feature-flagged
- Collect metrics for success criteria
- Address issues immediately
