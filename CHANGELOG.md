# Changelog

All notable changes to ApexStack are documented here.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-18

### Multi-project comes alive

v0.2 made forking apexstack the supported install path. v0.3 makes the **multi-project workflow** that fork enables actually work end-to-end: per-project context for the hooks, an upstream-drift signal at session start, and a one-command sync skill so keeping the fork current isn't archaeology.

- **Per-project active-ticket markers** (#41) — `require-active-ticket.sh` now resolves the active ticket per-project (one marker per `workspace/<name>/`), so working in two project clones in the same session no longer cross-contaminates ticket state.
- **`/update` skill** (#58) — sync the ops fork with `me2resh/apexstack` from one prompt: previews the commit delta, creates a sync branch (because direct push to main is blocked), merges or rebases, walks per-file conflicts, and leaves the branch ready to push as a PR.
- **SessionStart drift banner** (#63) — `check-upstream-drift.sh` runs at session start (cached to once per 10 minutes), prints a one-line banner when your fork is behind. Silent if up-to-date, silent on network failure, silent when no `upstream` remote is configured.

### Architecture diagrams as a first-class artefact

- **Mermaid C4 templates** (#50) — Level 1 (System Context) and Level 2 (Container) templates at `templates/architecture/`. ApexStack itself dogfoods the convention at `docs/architecture/apexstack-context.md` and `apexstack-container.md`.
- **`/handover` generates a stub C4 L2 container diagram** (#67) — onboarding an external repo now seeds a starter Mermaid diagram alongside the assessment, so new projects don't begin with an empty `docs/architecture/`.
- AgDR-0003 captures the choice of Mermaid C4 over Structurizr DSL / PlantUML / D2 — GitHub renders Mermaid inline, zero build step, no proprietary tooling.

### Database migrations get their own gate

Migrations are high-blast-radius work that sit awkwardly inside the standard build flow: rollback plans, downtime windows, lock contention, and cross-service consumers are easier to spec **before** the SQL is written than during PR review.

- **`require-migration-ticket.sh` hook** (#59) — fires on `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` against migration paths (`**/migrate-*.{ts,js,py,sql}`, `**/migrations/**`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, etc.). Verifies the active ticket has the `migration` label and references a migration AgDR. Project-config-overridable.
- **`/migration` skill** — guided flow that asks for migration type, affected tables, rollback plan, downtime estimate, cross-service consumers, data volume, testing plan, and observability — then creates the labelled ticket AND writes the AgDR in one step.
- **`templates/agdr-migration.md`** — migration-specific AgDR template that prompts for the rollback steps, the tested-against environment, and the consumers that need a pre-deploy heads-up.
- **Workflow gate 3a** added to `.claude/rules/workflow-gates.md`.

### Site refresh

- **Whole-framework positioning** (#73) — `site/index.html` retired the v0.1-era "rules + hooks" framing and now leads with the multi-project / portfolio model, the SDLC walkthrough, and the role-activated workflow as the headline.

### Hook robustness

- **`gh api .../merge` bypass closed** (#47) — all three merge-gate hooks now match both `gh pr merge` and the raw REST shape `gh api repos/.../pulls/N/merge`. Discovered after `me2resh/curios-dog#190` was merged via `gh api` while CI was still running. The shared PR-number extractor at `.claude/hooks/_lib-extract-pr.sh` recognises both forms.
- **Absolute-path exemptions in `require-active-ticket.sh`** (#56) — `/docs/`, `/projects/<name>/docs/`, and `*.md` paths are now exempt regardless of whether they're passed as relative or absolute. Closes a class of false-positive blocks when an editor passed absolute paths.
- **Rex marker format enforcement** (#62 → fix #66) — the code-reviewer agent definition now requires markers to be a bare 40-character SHA + newline. Earlier informal formats (`PR: 61\nSHA: ...`) silently broke the merge gate.
- **Merge gates resolve PR HEAD via `gh pr view`** — earlier hooks compared marker SHAs against `git rev-parse HEAD` (the local working tree), which forced a `gh pr checkout` dance before every merge. The hooks now resolve the PR's real HEAD on GitHub and fall back to local HEAD only with a visible warning when the gh call fails.
- **Reject closed-issue refs in PR + commit hooks** — `validate-pr-create.sh` and `verify-commit-refs.sh` now reject titles / commit messages referencing closed issues, not just non-existent ones.
- **Hooks resolve ops root from any workspace directory** — every hook now walks up from `$PWD` looking for `onboarding.yaml`, so they fire correctly when invoked from `workspace/<name>/` (the most common case in multi-project work).

### New skills

- `/migration` — guided migration ticket + AgDR creation (see migrations section above).
- `/update` — fork sync (see multi-project section above).
- `/feature`, `/bug`, `/task` — structured ticket templates with user-story / Given-When-Then / driver-scope-ACs scaffolds.

### Stats

- **17 commits** on `main` since v0.2.0 (9 features, 8 fixes), all PR-merged.
- **17 hooks** wired in `.claude/settings.json` (up from 15 in v0.2).
- **32 skills** available as slash commands (up from 27 in v0.2).
- **9 modular rule files** in `.claude/rules/` (unchanged).

### Upgrade notes

- `apexstack.projects.yaml` is unchanged from v0.2 — your registry continues to work.
- The new migration gate (`require-migration-ticket.sh`) is a no-op for projects that don't touch migration paths. If you have non-default migration locations, override `migration_paths` in `.claude/project-config.json`.
- The new `check-upstream-drift.sh` runs on every session start. It will be silent unless your fork is behind upstream — no action needed unless you see the banner. To skip the upstream check entirely, remove the SessionStart entry from `.claude/settings.json`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-12

### Mechanical enforcement layer

ApexStack's SDLC rules are no longer advisory prose — they're mechanically enforced by shell hooks that the Claude Code harness executes on every tool call.

**15 hooks** (up from 6 in v0.1):

- `require-active-ticket.sh` — blocks code edits without an active ticket
- `auto-code-review.sh` — auto-invokes the code-reviewer agent after PR creation
- `block-unreviewed-merge.sh` — two-marker merge gate (Rex + CEO approval required, both SHAs must match HEAD)
- `onboarding-check.sh` — prompts `/setup` on unconfigured forks
- `verify-commit-refs.sh` — blocks commits referencing non-existent issues
- `validate-commit-format.sh` — enforces conventional commit format (with project-config override)
- `require-agdr-for-arch-changes.sh` — requires AgDR when architecture files change
- `require-design-review-for-ui.sh` — blocks merge on UI PRs without design approval
- `block-merge-on-red-ci.sh` — blocks merge when any CI check is failing or pending
- `validate-branch-name.sh` — **now blocks** (was warning-only in v0.1)
- `validate-pr-create.sh` — **now blocks** on format errors + verifies referenced issues exist
- `block-git-add-all.sh` — blocks `git add -A / . / --all` (unchanged from v0.1)
- `block-main-push.sh` — blocks push to main/master (unchanged)
- `check-secrets.sh` — scans for hardcoded secrets (unchanged)
- `pre-push-gate.sh` — reminds to run CI checks locally (unchanged)

### New skills

**27 skills** (up from 13 in v0.1):

- `/setup` — first-run bootstrap: "describe your stack, accept defaults, done in 3 exchanges"
- `/start-ticket` — declare an active ticket before coding (required by the ticket-first hook)
- `/approve-merge` — record per-PR CEO approval (required by the merge gate)
- `/approve-design` — record per-PR design-review approval (required for UI PRs)
- `/launch-check` — 8-dimension production readiness audit at milestone boundaries (go/conditional-go/no-go verdict)
- `/threat-model` — STRIDE threat modelling exercise
- `/accessibility-audit` — WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit
- `/compliance-check` — GDPR + ePrivacy analysis
- `/analytics-audit` — event taxonomy and funnel coverage
- `/seo-audit` — technical SEO against Google best practices
- `/performance-audit` — bundle and Core Web Vitals analysis
- `/monitoring-audit` — observability and incident readiness
- `/docs-audit` — Diataxis documentation framework audit
- `/onboard` — deprecated, redirects to `/setup` (framework) and `/handover` (project)

### New rules

- `ticket-vocabulary.md` — reserves "Ticket", "#N", and dependency notation for real GitHub issues only. Prevents the vocabulary-collision failure mode where planning items wearing tracker notation are mistaken for tracker state.

### Agent Decision Records

- `AgDR-0001` — rule mechanization: which hooks to ship, which paths count as architecture/UI, which rules stay advisory
- `AgDR-0002` — warning-to-blocker upgrade for branch-name and PR-title validation

### CI dogfooding

ApexStack now runs its own CI:

- `pr-title-check.yml` — enforces ticket ID in PR titles
- `markdown-lint.yml` — lints all markdown files
- `shellcheck.yml` — static analysis on all hook scripts
- `link-check.yml` — validates URLs in docs and landing page (with weekly cron)

### Documentation

- `docs/rule-audit.md` — 73-row audit table mapping every MUST/NEVER/HARD-STOP rule to its enforcement mechanism (mechanized / partial / advisory / deferred)
- `.claude/hooks/README.md` — comprehensive documentation of all 15 hooks, session-state directory, testing instructions, and how to add new hooks
- Updated CLAUDE.md with all 27 skills, 15 hooks, and the explicit per-merge approval rule

### Breaking changes

- `validate-branch-name.sh` now **blocks** non-conforming branch names (was warning-only in v0.1)
- `validate-pr-create.sh` now **blocks** malformed PR titles, missing glossary, and missing branch ticket IDs (was warning-only in v0.1). Also blocks when the title's issue number doesn't exist in the tracker.
- `/onboard` skill is deprecated — use `/setup` for framework configuration, `/handover` for project onboarding
- `onboarding-check.sh` now checks `onboarding.yaml` for placeholder values instead of a gitignored session marker. Existing `.claude/session/onboarded` markers are no longer read.

### Key design principles introduced in v0.2

- **Prose rules the model drops under pressure → mechanical hooks.** If a rule is important, put it in a hook (exit 2 blocks the action). If it's a preference, put it in a rule file. If it's context, put it in CLAUDE.md.
- **Plan-level "go" is NOT merge approval.** Every `gh pr merge` requires its own per-PR, per-action explicit nod. Mechanically enforced by the two-marker merge gate.
- **Tracker vocabulary is reserved.** "Ticket", "#N", and dependency notation refer only to real GitHub issues. Planning items use "Step N" / "Item A" / plain bullets.
- **Describe, propose, confirm.** The `/setup` first-run UX collapses 7 sequential questions into 3 exchanges.
- **Overview → deep dive.** `/launch-check` is the 30-second sweep; each dimension has a dedicated expert skill for investigation.
