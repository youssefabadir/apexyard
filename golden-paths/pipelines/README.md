## Quick Start

These pipelines live inside your fork of apexyard (the ops repo) at `golden-paths/pipelines/`. To use them in a managed project, copy them into that project's own `.github/workflows/` directory.

### Option 1: Copy individual pipelines

```bash
# From your managed project's root (e.g. inside workspace/example-app/)
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy specific pipelines from your ops repo
cp ~/apexyard/golden-paths/pipelines/security.yml .github/workflows/
cp ~/apexyard/golden-paths/pipelines/code-quality.yml .github/workflows/
```

(Adjust `~/apexyard` to wherever you cloned your fork.)

### Option 2: Use the combined pipeline

```bash
cp ~/apexyard/golden-paths/pipelines/ci.yml .github/workflows/
```

## Pipeline Details

### PR Title Check (`pr-title-check.yml`)

**Purpose**: Governance — enforce ticket tracking.

**Checks performed**:

- Validates that the PR title contains a ticket ID
- Pattern: `[A-Z]{2,5}-\d+` (project tracker) or `#\d+` (GitHub Issues)

**Fail conditions**:

- No ticket ID found in PR title

**Valid title formats**:

- `feat(ABC-123): add new feature`
- `fix(#58): correct encryption claim`
- `ABC-123: Add new feature`

---

### Security (`security.yml`)

**Agent**: Shield (Security Scanner)

**Checks performed**:

- Semgrep SAST (OWASP Top 10, security-audit rules)
- npm audit (vulnerability scanning)
- TruffleHog (secrets detection)
- CodeQL (deep analysis on main branch)
- ESLint security plugin

**Fail conditions**:

- Critical or high severity vulnerabilities
- Exposed secrets detected

**Required secrets**:

- `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN` (optional, for Semgrep Cloud)

---

### Dependency Audit (`dependency-audit.yml`)

**Agent**: Guardian (Dependency Auditor)

**Checks performed**:

- npm audit (vulnerabilities by severity)
- npm outdated (major / minor / patch versions behind)
- license-checker (GPL, LGPL, unknown licenses)

**Automated actions**:

- Creates a GitHub issue for critical / high vulnerabilities
- Weekly scheduled audit (Monday 9 AM UTC)

**Fail conditions**:

- Critical vulnerabilities found

---

### Code Quality (`code-quality.yml`)

**Agent**: Rex (Code Reviewer)

**Checks performed**:

- TypeScript type checking (`npm run typecheck`)
- ESLint (`npm run lint`)
- Prettier formatting
- Tests (`npm run test`)
- Build verification

**Fail conditions**:

- TypeScript errors
- ESLint errors (warnings allowed)
- Test failures
- Build failures

---

### Review Check (`review-check.yml`)

**Agent**: Rex (verification)

**Purpose**: prevent merging code that was pushed *after* Rex's last review.

**Checks performed**:

- Verifies that Rex has reviewed the latest commit on the PR
- Compares commit SHAs from Rex's review against the current HEAD

**Fail conditions**:

- No Rex review found
- Rex's last review SHA does not match the current HEAD

---

### SEO Check (`seo-check.yml`)

**Pipeline**: SEO Check (no agent — pure CI workflow)

**Checks performed**:

- H1 title presence and uniqueness
- Meta description in frontmatter
- Content length (1000+ words recommended)
- Heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Image alt text
- Internal links (3+ recommended)
- External links to authoritative sources

**Scores**:

| Score | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 90–100 | Excellent |
| 70–89 | Good |
| 50–69 | Needs work |
| 0–49 | Poor |

**Fail conditions**: none by default (warning only). Uncomment the threshold check to fail hard.

### Terraform CI (`terraform-ci.yml`)

**Role**: Platform Engineer (Adel)

**For**: an AWS Terraform mono-repo orchestrated with [Terramate](https://terramate.io/), with per-stack remote state and keyless OIDC auth to AWS. It is a **copy-and-customize** template — unlike the Node pipelines, it has `# CUSTOMIZE` markers you must edit before it runs.

**Pipeline shape**:

```
fmt -check ─┐
validate    ├─► detect changed stacks ─► PLAN (matrix per stack) ─► APPLY (matrix per stack)
tflint      │     (Terramate)              • comments plan on PR     • main branch only
tfsec       ┘                              • plan-only on branches   • OIDC, retry-on-lock
```

**Checks performed**:

- `terraform fmt -check -recursive`
- `terraform validate` on changed stacks (`terramate run --changed`)
- `tflint` on changed stacks
- `tfsec` on changed stacks (soft-fail by default — see customize note)
- Change-detection via `terramate list --changed`, fanned out to a per-stack plan/apply matrix with isolated state + retry-on-lock-contention

**Branch behaviour**:

- **Feature branches / PRs** — plan only; the rendered plan is posted as a PR comment per stack. Nothing is applied.
- **`main`** — plan, then `terraform apply -auto-approve` per changed stack.

**Required secrets / vars** (set in the consuming repo):

| Name | What |
|------|------|
| `AWS_CI_ROLE_ARN` (secret) | Full ARN of the IAM role GitHub Actions assumes via OIDC. **Never hardcode an account ID in the workflow.** |
| `AWS_REGION` (env in file) | Your AWS region — edit the `env:` block. |
| Provider tokens (secrets) | Any provider/`TF_VAR_*` your stacks need (e.g. a DNS provider token) — wire them in the commented `env:` of the plan/apply steps. |

**Prerequisites (NOT provisioned by this template)**:

- The OIDC IAM role itself must already exist in your AWS account, with a trust policy scoped to your repo. The pipeline *assumes* the role; it does not create it.
- A Terraform backend (e.g. S3 + DynamoDB lock) configured per stack.
- Terramate stacks defined in the repo.

**`# CUSTOMIZE` points** (search the file):

- Tool versions (`TERRAMATE_VERSION`, `TF_VERSION`), `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_CI_ROLE_ARN`.
- The matrix-JSON `jq` block — adjust to your stack-path layout (the default assumes `<root>/<environment>/<account-slug>/<stack>`).
- The optional **stack-exclusion** filter in `detect-stacks` (`EXCLUDE` grep pattern).
- The optional **pre-plan/apply build hook** (e.g. building Lambda bundles) — commented out; delete if unused.
- `tfsec --soft-fail` — drop the flag to make security findings block.

### macOS Release (`macos-release.yml`)

**Role**: Platform Engineer (Adel)

**For**: shipping a signed, notarized macOS desktop app. It is the **release** half of the macOS golden path — pair it with `swift-ci.yml`, which handles PR-time build + test. Copy-and-customize (it has `# CUSTOMIZE` markers you must edit before it runs).

**Pipeline shape**:

```
tag v* ─► import Developer-ID cert (ephemeral keychain) ─► build .app ─► codesign
          (hardened runtime) ─► notarize + staple (notarytool) ─► package .dmg ─► GitHub Release
```

**Trigger**: a version tag push (`v*`); also `workflow_dispatch` with a `publish` toggle (build without releasing, e.g. to smoke-test signing).

**Required secrets** (set in the consuming repo):

| Name | What |
|------|------|
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64` | base64 of your **Developer ID Application** cert exported as `.p12`. |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | the `.p12` export password. |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | any random string — the ephemeral keychain's password. |
| `AC_API_KEY_ID` / `AC_API_ISSUER_ID` / `AC_API_KEY_P8_BASE64` | App Store Connect **API key** used by `notarytool` (Key ID, Issuer ID, and base64 of the `.p8`). The app-specific-password path is the documented alternative. |

**Prerequisites (NOT provisioned by this template)**:

- An **Apple Developer Program** membership.
- A **Developer ID Application** certificate (exported `.p12`).
- An **App Store Connect API key** (`.p8` + Issuer ID + Key ID) with access to notarization.

**`# CUSTOMIZE` points** (search the file):

- `APP_NAME` / `SCHEME` / `BUNDLE_ID` / `CONFIGURATION` / `XCODE_VERSION`.
- The **build step** — `xcodebuild` (shown) vs `swift build` + assembling a `.app`.
- The **packaging step** — `.dmg` via `create-dmg` (shown) vs a plain `.zip`.
- The release-tag pattern in `on.push.tags`.

**Security notes**: the signing identity is imported into an **ephemeral keychain** that's deleted in an `always()` cleanup step; secrets are never echoed; `permissions:` is `contents: read` except the release step which gets `contents: write`. Out of scope (documented extension points): Sparkle auto-update feeds, Mac App Store submission, and DMG background/layout design.

## Customisation

### Changing fail thresholds

In `security.yml`:

```yaml
env:
  FAIL_ON_SEVERITY: high  # change to: critical, high, medium, or low
```

### Adjusting schedules

In `dependency-audit.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # change cron expression
```

### Adding custom ESLint rules

In `code-quality.yml`, add rules to the eslint command:

```yaml
- name: Run ESLint with security plugin
  run: |
    npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx \
      --rule 'your-custom-rule: error'
```

---

## Required npm Scripts

Ensure your `package.json` has these scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx",
    "test": "vitest run",
    "build": "your-build-command"
  }
}
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Start with `code-quality.yml`** — basic quality gates
2. **Add `security.yml` early** — catch vulnerabilities before production
3. **Enable `dependency-audit.yml`** — weekly health checks
4. **Add `review-check.yml`** — once you have agents reviewing PRs
5. **Add `seo-check.yml` for content sites** — optimise discoverability
