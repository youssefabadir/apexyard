# /task — Create a Technical Task Ticket

Creates a structured GitHub Issue for a technical task with driver (why), scope (what), acceptance criteria, and risks. Used for tech debt, infrastructure, refactoring, dependency updates, or any non-user-facing work that doesn't fit /feature or /bug.

## Path resolution

Read the registry path via `portfolio_registry`, the per-project docs dir via `portfolio_projects_dir`, and the ideas backlog via `portfolio_ideas_backlog` — all from `.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh`. Source the helper at the top of any bash block that touches those paths:

```bash
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-read-config.sh"
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh"
registry=$(portfolio_registry)
```

Defaults match today's single-fork layout (`./apexyard.projects.yaml`, `./projects`, `./projects/ideas-backlog.md`). Adopters in split-portfolio mode override the `portfolio.{registry, projects_dir, ideas_backlog}` keys in `.claude/project-config.json`. Don't hardcode literal `apexyard.projects.yaml` or `projects/` paths in bash blocks — the helper resolves whichever mode the adopter is in. See `docs/multi-project.md`.

## Usage

```
/task Set up PR-triggered CI pipeline
/task Extract shared LikeCount component
/task Migrate from DiceBear to local avatars
```

## Process

### 0. Write the active-issue-skill marker (REQUIRED — me2resh/apexyard#268)

Before any `gh issue create` (or other tracker CLI), write this skill's name to the active-issue-skill marker so `require-skill-for-issue-create.sh` lets the command through. At skill entry:

```bash
# Resolve the ops-fork root the SAME way the hooks do (_lib-ops-root.sh):
# anchor on the .apexyard-fork marker (split-portfolio v2 — onboarding.yaml
# lives in the sibling portfolio repo, NOT the ops fork), falling back to the
# onboarding.yaml + apexyard.projects.yaml pair (single-fork v1).
ops_root="$PWD"; r="$PWD"
while [ "$r" != / ]; do
  if [ -f "$r/.apexyard-fork" ] || { [ -f "$r/onboarding.yaml" ] && [ -f "$r/apexyard.projects.yaml" ]; }; then
    ops_root="$r"; break
  fi
  r=${r%/*}
done
mkdir -p "$ops_root/.claude/session"
echo "task" > "$ops_root/.claude/session/active-issue-skill"
```

Remove the marker on **every** exit path (success, early-exit, user cancel, error):

```bash
rm -f "$ops_root/.claude/session/active-issue-skill"
```

The `clear-issue-skill-marker.sh` SessionStart hook sweeps stale markers from killed sessions, but a clean exit should never leave one behind. See AgDR-0030.

### 1. Resolve the target repo

Read `.claude/session/current-ticket` to determine which repo we're working in. If no active ticket, check `apexyard.projects.yaml` for managed projects. If only one project, use it. If multiple, ask:

```
Which project is this task for?
```

If no projects are registered, ask for the repo in `owner/repo` format.

### 2. Parse or ask for the title

Take the title from `$ARGUMENTS`. If empty, ask:

```
What's the task? Give me a short title.
```

### 3. Gather details (one question at a time)

Ask conversationally — do NOT batch all questions. Wait for each answer before asking the next.

**a) Driver**

```
Why is this work needed? (upstream ticket, tech debt rationale, Rex recommendation, dependency requirement, etc.)
```

**b) Scope**

```
What specifically needs to change? Be concrete — which files, services, or systems are affected.
```

**c) Acceptance Criteria**

```
What are the acceptance criteria? What must be true when this is done?
```

**d) Priority**

```
Priority?
1. P0 — blocks other work
2. P1 — important, schedule soon
3. P2 — nice to have, do when convenient
```

**e) Risks / Dependencies (optional)**

```
Any risks or dependencies? (what could block this, what depends on it, or Enter to skip)
```

### 4. Resolve the task body template

Resolve the task body template via the portfolio helper so adopter overrides win when present:

```bash
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-read-config.sh"
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh"
template=$(portfolio_resolve_template tickets/task.md)   # → custom-templates/tickets/task.md if present, else templates/tickets/task.md
```

Single-fork adopters (no `portfolio` block) and adopters with no override fall straight through to `templates/tickets/task.md`. Adopters who want a customised task-body shape drop their version at `<private_repo>/custom-templates/tickets/task.md`. See `templates/README.md` for the path-mirroring convention.

**Backward-compat fallback**: if `portfolio_resolve_template` returns empty (template file missing — partial adopter setup), fall back to the inline heredoc body below and print a one-line WARN on stderr (`WARN: tickets/task.md template missing — using inline fallback`).

### 5. Show the formatted ticket for confirmation

Substitute the gathered inputs into the resolved template (or the inline heredoc fallback), then display the full ticket using the resolved shape (the default `templates/tickets/task.md` shape is reproduced below):

```
Here's the ticket I'll create:

---
**[{Chore|Refactor|Test|CI}] {title}**

## Driver
{why this work is needed}

## Scope
{what specifically needs to change}

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {criterion 1}
- [ ] {criterion 2}
- [ ] ...

## Risks / Dependencies
{risks or "None identified"}

## Glossary
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| {term} | {definition} |
---

Labels: {type}, {P0|P1|P2}
Repo: {owner/repo}

Create this ticket? (yes / edit / cancel)
```

The title prefix is derived from the content, and must come from the project's configured prefix whitelist (`.claude/project-config.*.json` → `.ticket.prefix_whitelist`, default list at `.claude/project-config.defaults.json`). Shipped defaults map as follows:

- Testing work → `[Testing]`
- CI/CD work → `[CI]`
- Refactoring → `[Refactor]`
- Documentation-only change → `[Docs]`
- Everything else → `[Chore]`

A fork that extends the whitelist (e.g. adds `[Security]`, `[Perf]`, `[Scaffold]`) automatically gains the option here — the skill reads the live config, it does not hardcode the list. See apexyard#109 for the schema and how to extend.

### 6. Handle response

- **yes** / **looks good** / **go** → create the issue
- **edit** / **change X** → ask what to change, update, re-show
- **cancel** / **no** → abort

### 7. Create the issue (via the tracker abstraction)

Dispatch creation through `tracker_create` (#670 / AgDR-0072) so the issue lands
in **this project's** tracker — GitHub, GitLab, or a `custom` CLI — per its
`tracker:` block in `apexyard.projects.yaml`. For a GitHub adopter this runs
`gh issue create` exactly as before; no behaviour change.

```bash
# Resolve the tracker lib (it lives in the ops fork's hooks dir) by walking up
# from the cwd; source it.
tracker_lib="$(r="$PWD"; while [ -n "$r" ] && [ "$r" != / ]; do \
  [ -f "$r/.claude/hooks/_lib-tracker.sh" ] && { echo "$r/.claude/hooks/_lib-tracker.sh"; break; }; \
  r="${r%/*}"; done)"
# shellcheck source=/dev/null
. "$tracker_lib"

# Pass the body via a file (arbitrary markdown — never inline-interpolated).
body_file="$(mktemp)"
cat > "$body_file" <<'BODY'
{formatted body}
BODY

# tracker_create <owner/repo> <title> <body_file> [<labels_csv>] → {"ref","url"}.
# It is gated by require-skill-for-issue-create.sh; the active-issue-skill
# marker written in step 0 keeps this call allowed.
result="$(tracker_create "{owner/repo}" "[{type}] {title}" "$body_file" "{priority}")"
rc=$?
rm -f "$body_file"
if [ "$rc" -eq 3 ]; then
  # tracker.kind=none (shape-only): no tracker to create in. tracker_create
  # printed the rendered ticket body to stdout — surface it for manual /
  # external filing instead of a non-existent CLI/auth failure.
  echo "Tracker is 'none' (shape-only) — nothing was created in a tracker." >&2
  echo "File this in your external system (e.g. Jira/Linear via MCP):" >&2
  printf '%s\n' "$result"
  exit 0
elif [ "$rc" -ne 0 ] || [ -z "$result" ]; then
  echo "Ticket creation failed — check the tracker CLI / auth. Nothing was created." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

### 8. Return the result

Parse the normalised `{ref, url}` from `tracker_create`:

```bash
ref="$(printf '%s' "$result" | jq -r '.ref')"
url="$(printf '%s' "$result" | jq -r '.url')"
echo "Created: {owner/repo}#${ref} — {title}"
echo "${url}"
```

## Rules

1. **One question at a time.** Never batch questions. Wait for each answer.
2. **Always confirm before creating.** Show the full ticket and get explicit "yes".
3. **Driver is required.** Every technical task needs a "why".
4. **At least one acceptance criterion.** Don't create tasks with empty ACs.
5. **Labels auto-applied.** Priority label always applied.
6. **Title prefix.** Derived from the nature of the work: Testing, CI, Refactor, or Chore.
