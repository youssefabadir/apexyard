# /tasks — Actionable Task List

A single ordered list of "things to click on right now". Where `/inbox` groups items by category, `/tasks` flattens everything into a prioritised TODO with one URL per line. Optimised for "I have 30 minutes, what should I do?".

## Path resolution

Read the registry path via `portfolio_registry`, the per-project docs dir via `portfolio_projects_dir`, and the ideas backlog via `portfolio_ideas_backlog` — all from `.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh`. Source the helper at the top of any bash block that touches those paths:

```bash
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-read-config.sh"
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh"
registry=$(portfolio_registry)
```

Defaults match today's single-fork layout (`./apexyard.projects.yaml`, `./projects`, `./projects/ideas-backlog.md`). Adopters in split-portfolio mode override the `portfolio.{registry, projects_dir, ideas_backlog}` keys in `.claude/project-config.json`. Don't hardcode literal `apexyard.projects.yaml` or `projects/` paths in bash blocks — the helper resolves whichever mode the adopter is in. See `docs/multi-project.md`.

## Usage

```
/tasks
/tasks --top 10
/tasks --priority high
/tasks --markdown
```

## Scope

Iterates every project in `apexyard.projects.yaml` (the registry at the root of your ops repo).

## Where tasks come from

The task list is the union of:

| Source | Tool |
|--------|------|
| PRs awaiting your review | `gh pr list --search "review-requested:@me is:open"` |
| PRs you authored that are blocked on you (changes requested, conflicts, failing CI) | `gh pr list --search "author:@me is:open review:changes_requested"` |
| Issues assigned to you with high priority | `gh issue list --assignee @me --label priority-high,priority-critical` |
| Issues you opened with new comments | `gh issue list --search "author:@me commenter:>@me is:open"` |
| Mentions in unresolved threads | `gh search issues "mentions:@me is:open"` |
| PR comments awaiting your response | `gh api repos/{repo}/pulls/{n}/comments` filtered to threads where you were mentioned and the last reply isn't yours |
| Open Critical/High issues with no assignee in projects you own | `gh issue list --label priority-critical --assignee none` |
| Failing CI on your authored open PRs | from `statusCheckRollup` |

## Prioritisation

Tasks are scored and sorted. Higher score = closer to the top.

| Signal | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Failing CI on your own PR | +100 |
| PR ready to merge (approved, CI green) — yours | +90 |
| Critical issue assigned to you | +80 |
| PR review requested by name on you | +70 |
| PR review requested on a team you're in | +60 |
| Changes requested on your PR | +50 |
| High-priority issue assigned to you | +40 |
| New comment on an issue you opened | +30 |
| Mention in an open thread | +20 |
| Medium-priority issue assigned to you | +10 |
| Low-priority issue assigned to you | +1 |

Tie-breakers:

1. Older `updatedAt` first (stale things bubble up)
2. Same project as your current working directory first
3. Alphabetical by repo

## Action types

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `MERGE` | Approved + CI green — click merge |
| `FIX-CI` | Your PR has a failing check |
| `REVIEW` | A PR is waiting on your review |
| `FIX` | Your PR has changes requested |
| `TRIAGE` | An issue needs labelling, priority, or assignment |
| `REPLY` | A comment is waiting on your response |
| `WORK` | An issue assigned to you with no PR yet |
| `DECIDE` | A decision is blocking progress (`/decide` needed) |

## Filters

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--top N` | Only show the top N items |
| `--priority high` | Only critical and high priority |
| `--project <name>` | Limit to one project from the registry |
| `--type MERGE,REVIEW` | Comma-separated action types |
| `--markdown` | Markdown checklist output |
| `--json` | JSON output |

## Rules

1. **Always include the URL on every line** — the user needs to click
2. **One action per line** — don't bundle "review and merge" as one task
3. **Always sort by score, then staleness** — never alphabetical by default
4. **Multi-project aware** — iterate the registry, not the org
5. **Never modify anything** — read-only
6. **Skip resolved items** — if a PR is merged or an issue is closed mid-run, drop it
7. **Cap at 50 items by default** — if there are more, show count and suggest filters
8. **Prefer actionable over informational** — "11 PRs reviewed by others" is not a task
