# /setup — ApexYard First-Run Bootstrap

Configures `onboarding.yaml` for a new ApexYard fork in three exchanges instead of eight sequential questions. The "describe, propose, confirm" pattern gets most users from fork to working in under 2 minutes.

## Path resolution

Read the registry path via `portfolio_registry`, the per-project docs dir via `portfolio_projects_dir`, and the ideas backlog via `portfolio_ideas_backlog` — all from `.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh`. Source the helper at the top of any bash block that touches those paths:

```bash
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-read-config.sh"
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh"
registry=$(portfolio_registry)
```

Defaults match today's single-fork layout (`./apexyard.projects.yaml`, `./projects`, `./projects/ideas-backlog.md`). Adopters in split-portfolio mode override the `portfolio.{registry, projects_dir, ideas_backlog}` keys in `.claude/project-config.json`. Don't hardcode literal `apexyard.projects.yaml` or `projects/` paths in bash blocks — the helper resolves whichever mode the adopter is in. See `docs/multi-project.md`.

## When this runs

The `onboarding-check.sh` SessionStart hook detects that `onboarding.yaml` still has placeholder values (e.g. `company.name: "Your Company Name"`) and prompts the user to run `/setup`. After `/setup` fills in real values and commits, the hook goes silent forever — even on fresh clones, because `onboarding.yaml` is committed.

Re-running `/setup` on an already-configured fork shows the current config and asks what to update. Use `--reset` to clear everything and start from scratch.

## Process

### Step 0: Mark this session as bootstrap (REQUIRED)

`/setup` runs BEFORE any portfolio is configured, so no project tickets can exist yet. The `require-active-ticket.sh` PreToolUse hook would otherwise block every Edit / Write / Bash-write the skill needs to make. To stay coherent with the ticket-first rule without forcing adopters to file a placeholder ticket against nothing, the skill writes a one-line marker at `.claude/session/active-bootstrap` containing the skill name. The hook reads the marker and exempts skills listed in `ticket.bootstrap_skills` (in `.claude/project-config.defaults.json` — `setup` is on the default list).

Run this **before any tool calls that edit files**:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/session && echo "setup" > .claude/session/active-bootstrap
```

The marker is cleared in Step 8 below (and on the next SessionStart by `clear-bootstrap-marker.sh`, in case this skill is interrupted).

See AgDR-0011 + me2resh/apexyard#150 for the design rationale.

### Step 1: Check current state

Read `onboarding.yaml`. Two modes:

- **First run** (placeholder values detected): proceed to Step 2.
- **Already configured** (real values): show a summary of the current config and ask "What would you like to update?" — then jump to the specific section. Don't re-ask everything.
- **`--reset` flag**: clear `onboarding.yaml` back to the template defaults (copy from the upstream example or regenerate) and proceed as first run.

Detection: `grep -q '"Your Company Name"' onboarding.yaml` — if found, it's still a template.

### Step 2: One question — describe your world

Ask a single open-ended question:

```
Tell me about your company and tech stack in a few sentences.
For example: "We're a 3-person startup building a property management
SaaS. TypeScript + React frontend, AWS SAM backend with DynamoDB.
GitHub Issues for tracking, 1-week sprints."
```

**Do NOT ask sequential questions.** The whole point of this skill is to collapse the discovery into one natural-language exchange. The user describes their world; you parse it.

### Step 2a: Privacy gate — ask if any projects are private

Before parsing the description into config, ask one privacy question — this determines whether the adopter needs single-fork or split-portfolio mode (see `docs/multi-project.md`):

```
Quick one before I propose your config: are any of the projects you'll
manage on this fork private (i.e. not visible to the public)?

Why I'm asking: GitHub Free disallows changing a fork's visibility, so
under the standard fork-and-commit setup you might accidentally publish
your private project names on a public GitHub repo (a stray `git push`
after registering them — I won't push without your approval, but the
risk is on the adopter once the data is committed locally). If any
project is private, I'll walk you through the split-portfolio mode (a
separate private repo for the registry, public fork stays slim).

[y / n / "I'm on GitHub Pro/Team/Enterprise" — last option supports
private forks of public repos and avoids the issue.]
```

Branch on the answer:

- **n** (all projects public) → continue with **single-fork mode** (default; the rest of this skill applies as-is).
- **paid plan** (Pro / Team / Enterprise) → continue with **single-fork mode**, but mention that the registry will be on the (private-fork-eligible) fork and is fine.
- **y** (any private projects on GitHub Free) → switch to **split-portfolio mode** (Step 2b below).

Detection of an existing setup. Either form counts as "already in split-portfolio mode" — skip Step 2b:

- `.claude/project-config.json` has a `portfolio:` block pointing at a sibling repo (config-block mode, recommended; introduced #145), OR
- `apexyard.projects.yaml` is a symlink (`test -L apexyard.projects.yaml`; legacy mode, framework-version < #145).

### Step 2b: Walk through split-portfolio mode (only if Step 2a triggered)

The full setup lives in `docs/multi-project.md` § "Split-portfolio mode — public framework + private portfolio". This skill walks through it interactively. The recommended path uses the **`portfolio:` config block** (introduced in #145) rather than symlinks — both work, but the config block is the first-class option:

1. **Confirm the layout**: "Two repos in your account: `your-org/apexyard` (public, this fork) + `your-org/<private-name>` (new private repo for the portfolio). Both clones sit side-by-side on disk. OK?"
2. **Pick the private repo name**: default suggestion `your-org/ops`. Operator confirms or overrides.
3. **Create the private repo**: `gh repo create your-org/<name> --private --description "..."`. Confirm before running.
4. **Clone the private repo as a sibling**: `cd .. && gh repo clone your-org/<name> portfolio`.
5. **Initialise the portfolio**: `apexyard.projects.yaml` + empty `projects/` dir + initial commit + push. Same content as the doc's step 5.
6. **Configure path resolution in the fork** (recommended — config-block mode):
   - Append `.gitignore` lines for `apexyard.projects.yaml` and `projects` (so they don't accidentally get staged in the public fork even if the operator runs `git add -A`).
   - Untrack any tracked `projects/README.md` from the upstream framework.
   - Write `.claude/project-config.json` with the `portfolio:` block pointing at the sibling repo:

     ```json
     {
       "portfolio": {
         "registry": "../portfolio/apexyard.projects.yaml",
         "projects_dir": "../portfolio/projects",
         "ideas_backlog": "../portfolio/projects/ideas-backlog.md"
       }
     }
     ```

   - Stage `.gitignore` and `.claude/project-config.json` for commit (the latter is per-fork, not per-machine, since it points at a public sibling-repo path).
   - **Legacy fallback (framework-version < #145)**: if the adopter's framework predates the `portfolio:` config block, fall back to creating symlinks pointing at `../portfolio/apexyard.projects.yaml` and `../portfolio/projects`. The helper resolves either way.
7. **Verify**: source `.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh` and call `portfolio_validate`. Skill MUST refuse to declare success if validate fails — surface the specific failure and ask the operator to fix it before re-running.

   ```bash
   source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-read-config.sh"
   source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh"
   if ! portfolio_validate; then
     echo "Setup not complete — fix the issue above and re-run /setup"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

Then proceed to Step 3 with the user's earlier description, configuring `onboarding.yaml` as normal. The rest of the skill is unchanged — the only difference between modes is where the registry physically lives.

**Do NOT auto-migrate** an adopter who's already in single-fork mode with private project names already pushed. Direct them to the migration guide in `docs/multi-project.md` § "Migrating from single-fork to split-portfolio" — that flow involves a force-push history rewrite, redacting GitHub Issue / PR bodies, and a backup-branch dance, and is destructive enough to warrant a deliberate, eyes-open run rather than a `/setup` side-effect.

### Step 3: Parse and map to defaults

From the user's description, extract:

| Field | Parse from | Default if not mentioned |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| `company.name` | Company name in the description | Ask explicitly — this one's required |
| `company.mission` | What they're building | `""` (leave blank, user fills later) |
| `tech_stack.language` | "TypeScript", "Python", "Go", etc. | `"TypeScript"` |
| `tech_stack.framework` | "React", "Vue", "Svelte", etc. | `""` (no frontend) |
| `tech_stack.backend` | "Express", "FastAPI", "SAM", etc. | Inferred from language |
| `tech_stack.database` | "PostgreSQL", "DynamoDB", "MongoDB", etc. | `""` |
| `tech_stack.hosting` | "AWS", "GCP", "Azure", "Vercel", etc. | `"AWS"` |
| `project_management.tool` | "GitHub Issues", "Linear", "Jira" | `"GitHub Issues"` |
| `quality.required_checks` | Inferred from stack | `[lint, typecheck, test, build]` |
| `team` | Team size / roles mentioned | Minimal default (1 tech lead) |

Also infer non-obvious settings:

- If they mention "SAM" → `tech_stack.iac: "AWS SAM"` and add `sam validate --lint` to implied checks
- If they mention "Terraform" → `tech_stack.iac: "Terraform"` and add `terraform validate`
- If they mention "no frontend" or don't mention a framework → `workflows.require_design_review: false` (no UI = no design gate)
- If they mention "solo" or "1 person" → simplify team to just them, `required_reviews: 0`

### Step 4: Present the proposed config

Show a clean summary (NOT raw YAML — a formatted table or bulleted list):

```
Based on your description, here's how I'd configure your fork:

Company: ApexScript
Stack: TypeScript + React (frontend), AWS SAM + DynamoDB (backend)
Hosting: AWS
CI checks: npm run lint, npm run typecheck, npm run test, npm run build, sam validate --lint
Tracker: GitHub Issues, 1-week sprints
Reviewers: Rex (code-reviewer agent) + you
Quality: 80% coverage target, thorough review style
Team: 1 tech lead (you)

Design review gate: ON (React = UI work)
AgDR gate: ON (default architecture paths)
Commit types: framework defaults (feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, style, perf, build, ci, revert)

Use these defaults, or customize?
```

### Step 5: Confirm or customize

- **"yes" / "looks good" / "use defaults"** → proceed to Step 6.
- **"customize X"** → ask about the specific field, update, re-show the summary with the change highlighted, re-confirm.
- **"no, actually we use Y"** → re-parse, re-propose.

Don't loop more than twice. If the user keeps correcting, switch to "tell me exactly what to change" direct-edit mode.

### Step 6: Write onboarding.yaml

Read the current `onboarding.yaml` template, replace placeholder values with the confirmed config, and write back. Preserve the file's structure and comments — the comments are documentation for future readers.

**Important:** use `Edit` tool to modify in-place, not `Write` to overwrite — this preserves comments and structure that the user didn't touch.

After writing:

```bash
git add onboarding.yaml
```

Stage but do NOT commit — let the user review the diff and commit when ready. Tell them:

```
onboarding.yaml updated and staged. Review with `git diff --cached` and
commit when you're happy: git commit -m "chore: configure apexyard for <company>"
```

### Step 7: Optionally seed the project registry

If the user mentioned a specific project in their description, offer to add it:

```
You mentioned a property management SaaS. Want me to register it as
your first managed project in apexyard.projects.yaml?
I'll need: repo name (owner/repo) and a short project name.
```

If yes → append to `apexyard.projects.yaml`, stage alongside `onboarding.yaml`.
If no → skip. They can add projects later with `/handover`.

### Step 8: Clear the bootstrap marker (REQUIRED)

```bash
rm -f .claude/session/active-bootstrap
```

Always remove the marker on a clean exit so subsequent edits in the same session go through the normal ticket gate. If `/setup` is interrupted before this step, `clear-bootstrap-marker.sh` (SessionStart hook) clears the stale marker on the next session.

## Rules

1. **One question to start.** Do not ask about company, then stack, then team, then tools separately. One open-ended prompt, one natural-language response, one proposed config.
2. **Propose, don't interrogate.** Show the full config with sensible defaults and let the user correct. Most fields have obvious defaults from the description.
3. **Stage, don't commit.** The user should see the diff before it's committed. `/setup` stages; the user commits.
4. **Preserve structure.** `onboarding.yaml` has comments that explain each section. Don't blow them away — edit in place.
5. **Idempotent.** Running `/setup` again shows current config and asks what to update. Running with `--reset` clears and re-asks.
6. **No project-config.json.** `/setup` configures the FRAMEWORK (onboarding.yaml). Per-project config is handled by `/handover` and `/idea` when projects enter the portfolio.
