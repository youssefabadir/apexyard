# /handover — External Repo Handover Assessment

Adopt an external repo into ApexYard management. The skill reads the target repo, synthesises a structured handover document, and tells you which ApexYard roles, workflows, and hooks should kick in.

This is the bridge between "we just inherited this codebase" and "this codebase is now governed by our normal SDLC".

## Path resolution

Read the registry path via `portfolio_registry`, the per-project docs dir via `portfolio_projects_dir`, and the ideas backlog via `portfolio_ideas_backlog` — all from `.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh`. Source the helper at the top of any bash block that touches those paths:

```bash
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-read-config.sh"
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh"
registry=$(portfolio_registry)
```

Defaults match today's single-fork layout (`./apexyard.projects.yaml`, `./projects`, `./projects/ideas-backlog.md`). Adopters in split-portfolio mode override the `portfolio.{registry, projects_dir, ideas_backlog}` keys in `.claude/project-config.json`. Don't hardcode literal `apexyard.projects.yaml` or `projects/` paths in bash blocks — the helper resolves whichever mode the adopter is in. See `docs/multi-project.md`.

## Usage

```
/handover legacy-billing-api
/handover legacy-billing-api ../legacy-billing-api
/handover marketing-site https://github.com/some-org/marketing-site
```

## Output location

The skill writes two files under `projects/<name>/`:

```
projects/<name>/handover-assessment.md         ← always (re)written
projects/<name>/architecture/container.md      ← only if missing — stub L2 C4 diagram
```

The folder lives in the ops repo (your fork of apexyard), alongside the rest of `projects/`.

If `projects/<name>/` doesn't exist, create it. Also seed a `projects/<name>/README.md` stub if missing — see `projects/README.md` for the convention.

The architecture stub is **written once** and never overwritten — it's a starting point, not a generated artefact. After the first handover, any edits the team makes to refine the diagram survive re-runs of the skill.

## Process

### 0. Mark this session as bootstrap (REQUIRED)

`/handover` may run before any tracker tickets exist for the project being adopted, so the `require-active-ticket.sh` PreToolUse hook would block the registry / `projects/<name>/` writes the skill needs. Write a marker so the hook exempts this skill (it's on the default `bootstrap_skills` list in `.claude/project-config.defaults.json`):

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/session && echo "handover" > .claude/session/active-bootstrap
```

Clear the marker on completion (Step "Post-Handover Checklist" below). If the skill is interrupted, the SessionStart hook `clear-bootstrap-marker.sh` clears it at the start of the next session. See AgDR-0011 + me2resh/apexyard#150.

### 1. Locate the target repo

If a path is given, use it. If a URL is given, prompt the user to clone it into `workspace/<name>/` first (don't clone automatically — that's a side-effect with cost). If nothing is given, ask:

```
Where is the target repo? Local path or git URL?
```

### 2. Read the surface area

Without running anything destructive, gather:

```bash
# Tree (top 2 levels, prune node_modules / .git)
find <repo> -maxdepth 2 -type d \
  ! -path '*/node_modules*' \
  ! -path '*/.git*' \
  ! -path '*/dist*' \
  ! -path '*/build*'

# Key files
ls <repo>/README* <repo>/package.json <repo>/pyproject.toml \
   <repo>/Cargo.toml <repo>/go.mod <repo>/Gemfile 2>/dev/null

# CI config
ls <repo>/.github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null

# Last commit & contributors
git -C <repo> log -1 --format='%h %ai %an %s'
git -C <repo> shortlog -sn --no-merges | head -10

# Open issues / PRs (if it's a GitHub repo)
gh -R <owner/name> issue list --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 10
gh -R <owner/name> pr list --state open --json number,title --limit 10
```

### 3. Detect the tech stack

Look at:

- `package.json` → Node ecosystem; check `engines`, `scripts`, `dependencies`
- `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` → Python
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust
- `go.mod` → Go
- `Gemfile` → Ruby
- `Dockerfile` → containerised; what base image?
- `.github/workflows/` → existing CI; how mature?
- `tsconfig.json` strictness, presence of tests, presence of linters

### 4. Try a build (optional, ask first)

```
Should I attempt to build the project to check current health? (y/n)
```

If yes and it's a Node project: `npm install --ignore-scripts && npm run build` (or whatever the package.json scripts say). Capture pass/fail and any errors.

### 5. Synthesise the assessment

Write `projects/<name>/handover-assessment.md`:

````markdown
# {name} — Handover Assessment

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Assessor**: {git user}
**Status**: handover

## Origin

- **Where it came from**: {acquisition / inherited team / open source / contractor / etc.}
- **Original owner**: {if known}
- **Repo location**: {URL or path}
- **First commit date**: {from git log}
- **Last commit date**: {from git log}

## Current State

### Tech stack
- Language: {…}
- Runtime: {…}
- Framework: {…}
- Database: {…}
- Test framework: {…}
- CI: {…}

### Build status
- `npm install`: {ok / failed}
- `npm run build`: {ok / failed / not attempted}
- `npm run test`: {ok / failed / not attempted}
- `npm run lint`: {ok / failed / not attempted}

### Test coverage
- Estimated: {…} (from coverage report if available, otherwise "unknown")

### Repo activity
- Commits in last 90 days: {…}
- Open issues: {…}
- Open PRs: {…}
- Top contributors: {…}

## Quality Risks

### Security
- {known CVEs in deps, hardcoded secrets, missing auth, etc.}

### Dependencies
- {abandoned packages, major versions behind, license issues}

### Technical debt
- {missing tests, no types, dead code, tangled architecture, etc.}

### Operational
- {missing CI, no monitoring, no deploy automation, etc.}

## Integration Plan

### Roles that apply
- {tech-lead, backend-engineer, frontend-engineer, sre, security-auditor, …}

### Workflows that kick in
- [ ] PR workflow (`.claude/rules/pr-workflow.md`) — every change goes through a PR
- [ ] AgDR for technical decisions
- [ ] Code Reviewer agent on every PR
- [ ] Security Reviewer agent on first pass and high-risk PRs
- [ ] `/audit-deps` on adoption and monthly thereafter

### Hooks to enable
- [ ] `block-git-add-all`
- [ ] `block-main-push`
- [ ] `validate-branch-name` (set `ticket_prefix` for this project's tracker)
- [ ] `validate-pr-create`
- [ ] `pre-push-gate`
- [ ] `check-secrets`

### CI templates to copy in
- [ ] `golden-paths/pipelines/ci.yml`
- [ ] `golden-paths/pipelines/security.yml`
- [ ] `golden-paths/pipelines/pr-title-check.yml`

### Registry entry

The entry that will be appended to `apexyard.projects.yaml` at the root of the ops repo (see step 7 — the skill does this append for you, with confirmation):

```yaml
- name: {name}
  repo: {owner/name}
  workspace: workspace/{name}
  docs: projects/{name}
  status: handover
  roles:
    {dynamically derived from the tech stack + CI config — see
     "Deriving applicable roles" below}
```

**Deriving applicable roles**: don't hard-code `[tech-lead, backend-engineer]`. Look at the tech stack from step 3:

| Signal | Add role |
|--------|----------|
| Any backend code (package.json with server deps, pyproject.toml, etc.) | `backend-engineer` |
| Any UI code (React/Vue/Svelte, `src/components/`, CSS modules) | `frontend-engineer` |
| CI config detected (`.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, etc.) | `platform-engineer` |
| Production deployment evidence (Dockerfile, Terraform, AWS/GCP/Azure SDK) | `sre` |
| Auth / crypto / secrets in the diff | `security-auditor` |
| Always | `tech-lead` |

For a typical handover you'll end up with 3-5 roles in the list.

## Next Steps

Derived dynamically from the Quality Risks found in this assessment. Don't emit generic placeholders — emit specific actions.

Mapping table:

| Risk found | Next step entry |
|------------|-----------------|
| ≥ 1 CVE in deps (any severity) | `1. /audit-deps {name} — triage the {severity} {package} CVE before any new feature work` |
| Failing tests | `2. Fix the {N} failing tests in {module} before merging new PRs (baseline must be green)` |
| No observability (no Sentry/Datadog/CloudWatch/etc.) | `3. /decide on observability ({two most common options for this stack})` |
| Stale CI (no runs in > 30 days) | `4. Re-enable CI on this repo — copy in golden-paths/pipelines/ci.yml` |
| Test coverage unknown | `5. Set up test coverage reporting (vitest/jest coverage config) before the first feature` |
| ≥ 10 open issues | `6. Triage the issue backlog with the previous owner before taking ownership` |
| Missing README or onboarding doc | `7. Write a minimum-viable README (what the project does, how to run it locally, where it deploys)` |

If no risks match a row, omit that row. If fewer than 3 actions come out, add:

- `{next} /code-review the most-recent PR on this repo as Rex to calibrate review standards`
- `{next} Stakeholder sync with the previous owner to cover context the static read couldn't surface`

## Cleanup (REQUIRED before exit)

```bash
rm -f .claude/session/active-bootstrap
```

Always remove the bootstrap marker on a clean exit. If the skill is interrupted before this step, `clear-bootstrap-marker.sh` clears the stale marker on the next session.

## Post-Handover Checklist

Also derived from the risks found. Tailor to the specific repo — don't emit generic items.

- [ ] Review this assessment with the previous owner
- [ ] {top quality risk} — close before the first feature PR
- [ ] {second quality risk} — scheduled in the first 2 weeks
- [ ] Add `{name}` to the weekly `/stakeholder-update` rollup
- [ ] Onboard the roles listed above into the team's on-call / review rotation
- [ ] Set up a test coverage baseline (run `npm test -- --coverage` or equivalent and commit the threshold)
- [ ] Run `/audit-deps {name}` monthly for the next 3 months

## Open Questions

- {anything you couldn't determine from a static read}

### 6. Write the L2 container diagram stub (if missing)

**Skip condition**: if `projects/<name>/architecture/container.md` already exists, skip this entire step and note it in the final summary (`architecture/container.md: preserved`). Never overwrite.

If missing: emit a stub Mermaid C4 container diagram derived from the repo signals gathered in step 3. The goal is a file the user can render on GitHub immediately and then refine — correctness beats completeness.

#### Container-detection signals

Scan the repo for these, in order. Stop at the first match per slot where it makes sense (only one `web`, only one primary `db`), but accumulate for multi-service slots (workers, caches, queues can coexist).

**Slot: `web` (frontend / SPA)**

| Signal | Label | Tech label |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `package.json` has `next` or `@next/*` | Web App | `Next.js` |
| `package.json` has `react-scripts` | Web App | `React / CRA` |
| `package.json` has `vite` + React dep | Web App | `React / Vite` |
| `package.json` has `@remix-run/*` | Web App | `Remix` |
| `package.json` has `svelte` / `@sveltejs/kit` | Web App | `SvelteKit` |
| `package.json` has `nuxt` | Web App | `Nuxt` |
| `package.json` has `@angular/core` | Web App | `Angular` |
| `src/components/` or `src/pages/` exists | Web App | (infer from `package.json`) |

If none match → omit the web container. Not all projects have a frontend.

**Slot: `api` (HTTP backend)**

| Signal | Label | Tech label |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `package.json` has `express` | API | `Node.js / Express` |
| `package.json` has `fastify` | API | `Node.js / Fastify` |
| `package.json` has `hono` | API | `Node.js / Hono` |
| `package.json` has `@nestjs/core` | API | `NestJS` |
| `package.json` has `koa` | API | `Node.js / Koa` |
| Next.js project with `app/api/` or `pages/api/` | API | `Next.js API routes` (same container as web, or split if clearly separate service) |
| `go.mod` has `net/http` handlers / `gin` / `echo` / `chi` / `fiber` | API | `Go / <framework>` |
| `pyproject.toml` has `fastapi` / `django` / `flask` | API | `Python / <framework>` |
| `Gemfile` has `rails` / `sinatra` | API | `Ruby / <framework>` |
| `Cargo.toml` has `axum` / `actix-web` / `rocket` | API | `Rust / <framework>` |

If the project is a monolith Next.js app with API routes, collapse `web` + `api` into one container labelled `Web App + API` with tech `Next.js` — don't fabricate a split the code doesn't have.

**Slot: `worker` (async / background jobs)**

| Signal | Label | Tech label |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `package.json` has `bullmq` / `bee-queue` / `agenda` | Background Worker | `Node.js / <lib>` |
| `package.json` has `@inngest/*` | Background Worker | `Inngest` |
| `workers/` directory with job handlers | Background Worker | (infer) |
| `pyproject.toml` has `celery` | Background Worker | `Python / Celery` |

If none → omit.

**Slot: `db` (primary relational / document store)**

| Signal | Label | Tech label |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `prisma/schema.prisma` with `datasource db { provider = "postgresql" }` | Primary Database | `PostgreSQL (Prisma)` |
| Same, provider = `mysql` / `sqlite` / `mongodb` / etc. | Primary Database | `<Provider> (Prisma)` |
| `drizzle.config.ts` or `drizzle.config.js` | Primary Database | `<driver> (Drizzle)` |
| `knexfile.{js,ts}` | Primary Database | `<client from config> (Knex)` |
| `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.example` with `postgres://` / `mysql://` / `mongodb://` | Primary Database | `<Protocol-derived>` |
| `supabase/config.toml` | Primary Database | `Supabase (PostgreSQL)` |
| `firebase.json` with firestore config | Primary Database | `Firestore` |

Use `ContainerDb(db, ...)` (the `Db` suffix changes the icon in Mermaid C4).

**Slot: `cache`**

| Signal | Label | Tech label |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `package.json` has `ioredis` / `redis` / `@upstash/redis` | Cache | `Redis` |
| `REDIS_URL` / `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL` in `.env.example` | Cache | `Redis` |
| `package.json` has `memcached` / `memjs` | Cache | `Memcached` |

Use `ContainerDb(cache, ...)`.

**Slot: `queue` (if distinct from `worker`)**

| Signal | Label | Tech label |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| AWS SDK with SQS usage (grep for `@aws-sdk/client-sqs`) | Queue | `AWS SQS` |
| `package.json` has `kafkajs` | Queue | `Kafka` |
| `package.json` has `amqplib` / `@cloudamqp/*` | Queue | `RabbitMQ` |

Only include a separate queue container if it's clearly distinct from worker infrastructure — otherwise fold into the worker's tech label.

**Slot: external systems (from `System_Ext`)**

Infer from:

- Auth SDKs: `@auth0/*` / `@clerk/*` / `next-auth` / `@supabase/auth-*` → `Auth Provider`, tech `Auth0` / `Clerk` / etc.
- Payments: `stripe` / `@paddle/*` → `Payment Processor`
- Email: `postmark` / `@sendgrid/*` / `resend` / `@aws-sdk/client-ses` → `Email Provider`
- Storage: `@aws-sdk/client-s3` / `@vercel/blob` / `@cloudflare/r2` → `Object Storage`
- LLM: `openai` / `@anthropic-ai/sdk` / `@google-ai/*` → `LLM API`

Include only the externals you find evidence for. Don't fabricate a Stripe dependency.

**docker-compose.yml override**

If `docker-compose.yml` exists at the repo root, it's a stronger signal than `package.json` for container composition — the compose services ARE the containers. For each service:

- Map `image: postgres:*` or `image: mysql:*` → `ContainerDb(db, ...)`
- Map `image: redis:*` → `ContainerDb(cache, "Cache", "Redis", ...)`
- Map `image: node:*` / `image: python:*` / `image: ruby:*` with a `build:` context → generic `Container(...)`, use the build context path as a hint
- Map named application services (from `build: ./api`, `build: ./web`) to `api` / `web` slots

When compose and `package.json` conflict, trust compose — it describes the deployment shape the project actually runs in.

**Dockerfile-only**

If there's a `Dockerfile` at repo root but no `docker-compose.yml`: one container, tech = the `FROM` base image (e.g. `node:20-alpine`). Pair it with whatever `package.json` says is the runtime. Don't invent a database container without signal.

#### Assembling the file

Start from `templates/architecture/c4-container.md` (the template shipped in #50). Replace:

- `{Project Name}` → the project's real name (from the handover)
- The sample `System_Boundary` contents → the containers you detected
- The sample `Rel(...)` edges → a reasonable first pass:
  - `user → web` (HTTPS) if there's a `web`
  - `web → api` (HTTPS / JSON) if there's both
  - `api → db` (SQL or driver-specific) if there's a `db`
  - `api → cache` (TCP) if there's a `cache`
  - `api → worker` (enqueue) if there's a `worker`
  - `worker → <external>` (API) for each external the worker plausibly calls
  - `api → <external>` for each external the API plausibly calls

Also replace the bottom-of-file guidance section with a brief "Handover-generated — refine me" note so the user knows this was machine-drafted. Render the following literal blockquote + Maintenance section into the target file (the content below is the exact Markdown to write):

- A blockquote starting with `> **Note**: this diagram was auto-generated by /handover on YYYY-MM-DD from repo signals (package.json, docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, Prisma schema, .env.example). It is a **starting point** — review and refine.`
- Continue with a bulleted list inside the blockquote:
  - "Container labels and tech strings — the detector may have picked a framework version wrong"
  - "Inferred relationships — user → web assumes HTTPS; adjust if your stack uses something else"
  - "External systems — anything your team uses that isn't in package.json (e.g. infra-only dependencies, direct cloud APIs called via HTTP) won't have been detected"
- Close with: `> Update the "Maintenance" section below once the diagram is stable.`
- Then a blank line, then a second-level heading `## Maintenance`, then one line: `(From the template — update when L2 containers change.)`

#### Write path

```
projects/<name>/architecture/container.md
```

Create `projects/<name>/architecture/` if missing.

#### If there's nothing meaningful to draw

If after scanning you find zero signals (no `package.json`, no `pyproject.toml`, no Dockerfile, no known framework, no DB), skip the file and note in the summary: `architecture/container.md: skipped (no container signals detected — add manually from templates/architecture/c4-container.md when ready)`. Better to write nothing than fabricate a wrong diagram.

### 7. Append to the portfolio registry

**Don't just print the snippet** — offer to append it automatically:

```

Ready to add {name} to apexyard.projects.yaml? (y/n)
> y

```

If yes:

1. **Locate the registry**: `apexyard.projects.yaml` at the root of the ops repo. If missing, first copy from `apexyard.projects.yaml.example` and show the user a warning: `⚠ Registry didn't exist — created from .example. You may need to fill in other projects.`

2. **Append the entry**. Use `yq` if available for a safe YAML edit, otherwise append as plain text with careful indentation. Resolve the registry path via the helper (single-fork or split-portfolio — same code path):

   ```bash
   source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-read-config.sh"
   source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh"
   REGISTRY=$(portfolio_registry)

   # Prefer yq for correctness
   if command -v yq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     yq eval -i '.projects += [{"name": "{name}", "repo": "{owner/name}", "workspace": "workspace/{name}", "docs": "projects/{name}", "status": "handover", "roles": [{roles}]}]' "$REGISTRY"
   else
     # Fallback: plain text append
     cat >> "$REGISTRY" <<'YAML'
     - name: {name}
       repo: {owner/name}
       workspace: workspace/{name}
       docs: projects/{name}
       status: handover
       roles:
         - tech-lead
         - backend-engineer
   YAML
   fi
   ```

3. **Validate the result**:

   ```bash
   # Prefer yq or python -c 'import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open(path))'
   yq eval '.' "$REGISTRY" >/dev/null 2>&1 \
     || python3 -c "import sys, yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('$REGISTRY'))" 2>&1
   ```

   If validation fails: **restore the previous version** from a backup made before the write, print the parse error, and tell the user to fix it manually. Never leave the registry in a broken state.

4. **Confirm to the user**:

   ```
   ✓ Added {name} to apexyard.projects.yaml
     status: handover
     roles: {the derived list}
   ```

If the user says `n` at the prompt, print the snippet they'd need to copy manually and continue to step 8 without writing anything:

```
Skipping the auto-append. If you want to add it later, copy this into apexyard.projects.yaml:

  - name: {name}
    repo: {owner/name}
    workspace: workspace/{name}
    docs: projects/{name}
    status: handover
    roles: {derived list}
```

### 8. Offer validation (conditional, default-no)

If the project looks **dormant** by the heuristic — last commit > 90 days ago AND zero open PRs AND no recent issue activity (rough thresholds, the skill can probe `gh repo view` + `gh pr list` + `gh issue list` to compute) — ask:

```
This project looks dormant — run /validate-idea {name} to confirm it's
still worth investing in? y/n (default n)
```

If the user accepts, hand off to `/validate-idea {name}` (which reads the just-written `handover-assessment.md` as starting context and writes its output to `projects/{name}/validation/handover-validation.md`).

If the project is healthy (recent commits, active PRs/issues), skip the prompt entirely. Don't ask "should I validate?" on every handover — only when the dormancy signal warrants it.

### 9. Return a summary

```
Handover assessment written: projects/{name}/handover-assessment.md
Architecture stub:           projects/{name}/architecture/container.md ({written | preserved | skipped})
Registry updated:            apexyard.projects.yaml ({added | skipped})
Validation:                  {"completed — verdict <GREEN|YELLOW|RED>" | "skipped" | "not offered (project is active)"}

Tech stack: {one-liner}
Build: {ok / failed}
Risks: {N items} ({highest severity})
Roles activated: {comma-separated}
Top 3 next steps:
  1. {first dynamic step}
  2. {second dynamic step}
  3. {third dynamic step}
```

## Rules

1. **Read-only against the target repo** — never modify the target repo without explicit permission. (The ops repo IS modified — you append to the registry and create the assessment file — but that's the point.)
2. **Honest assessment** — if a build fails, say so. Don't paper over problems.
3. **Always seed `projects/<name>/`** — even if minimal.
4. **Auto-append to the registry** (with confirmation) — don't leave the user to copy-paste a snippet. Propose the append, validate the resulting YAML, roll back on failure.
5. **Derive roles from the stack** — don't hard-code `[tech-lead, backend-engineer]`. The roles list depends on the actual tech stack, CI config, and security surface detected in step 3.
6. **Derive next steps from the risks** — don't emit generic placeholders. Every "Next Step" must correspond to a specific finding from the Quality Risks section of the assessment.
7. **Never auto-clone** — ask for the path.
8. **Never store secrets** — if `.env` is found, list its presence but never read its contents.
9. **Status starts at `handover`** — moves to `active` only after the integration plan is executed.
10. **Never break the registry** — if the YAML append breaks the file, restore the previous version and ask the user to edit manually.
11. **Never overwrite the architecture stub** — `projects/<name>/architecture/container.md` is written once on first handover, then owned by the team. Re-runs of `/handover` (e.g. if the tech stack changed) must preserve any manual refinements. If you want to regenerate, the user deletes the file first.
12. **Architecture stubs are starting points, not truths** — the auto-generated note at the top of the file explicitly tells the user to review and refine. Never claim the detector is authoritative.

## When to use this

| Trigger | Use `/handover`? |
|---------|------------------|
| Inherited a codebase from another team | Yes |
| Acquired a company's repo | Yes |
| Adopted an open-source project as a dependency | No — that's `/audit-deps` |
| Forked an internal tool you wrote yesterday | No — it's already yours |
| Importing a side project into the org | Yes |
