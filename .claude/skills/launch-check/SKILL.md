# /launch-check — Production Readiness Audit

Runs an 8-dimension sweep against a project and outputs a one-page verdict. Designed for milestone boundaries — epic completion, release cuts, launch prep — not per-PR use.

**Invoke from** the project's workspace directory (`cd workspace/<project>/`) or pass the path as an argument: `/launch-check workspace/my-app`.

**Two modes:**

- `/launch-check [project-path]` — full audit (default). Runs all 8 dimensions, persists results to the per-project history store, and renders a "Trend (last 5 runs)" section when ≥ 2 prior runs exist.
- `/launch-check trend [project-path]` — read-only trend report. Renders just the trend section from existing run files. Useful for "are we trending up?" without burning the audit cost. See § "Trend-only mode" below.

## Deep-dive companions

Each dimension has a dedicated expert skill for when you need to go deeper than the one-line summary. The launch check is the overview; the expert skills are the investigation.

| Dimension | Quick check | Deep dive |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Security | `/launch-check` row 1 | **`/threat-model`** — full STRIDE threat modelling exercise |
| Accessibility | `/launch-check` row 2 | **`/accessibility-audit`** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit |
| Compliance | `/launch-check` row 3 | **`/compliance-check`** — GDPR + ePrivacy analysis |
| Analytics | `/launch-check` row 4 | **`/analytics-audit`** — event taxonomy and funnel coverage |
| SEO | `/launch-check` row 5 | **`/seo-audit`** — technical SEO against Google best practices |
| Performance | `/launch-check` row 6 | **`/performance-audit`** — bundle, images, Core Web Vitals |
| Monitoring | `/launch-check` row 7 | **`/monitoring-audit`** — observability and incident readiness |
| Documentation | `/launch-check` row 8 | **`/docs-audit`** — Diataxis framework completeness |

When a dimension shows WARN or FAIL, tell the user: *"For a detailed analysis, run `/threat-model`"* (or the relevant expert skill).

## Output format

The output should be **scannable in 10 seconds**. One table, one verdict, one blockers list:

```
LAUNCH CHECK — <project> @ <sha> (<date>)

| #  | Dimension       | Status | Finding                              |
|----|-----------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| 1  | Security        | PASS   | No critical vulns, auth flow ok      |
| 2  | Accessibility   | WARN   | 3 images missing alt text            |
| 3  | Compliance      | FAIL   | No cookie consent banner detected    |
| 4  | Analytics       | PASS   | GA4 configured, 12 events tracked    |
| 5  | SEO             | WARN   | Missing og:image on 2 pages          |
| 6  | Performance     | PASS   | Bundle < 200KB, LCP < 2.5s          |
| 7  | Monitoring      | FAIL   | No health check endpoint found       |
| 8  | Documentation   | PASS   | README updated this week             |

Verdict: CONDITIONAL GO (2 failures need resolution)

Blocking:
  - [ ] Add cookie consent banner (compliance)
  - [ ] Add /health endpoint (monitoring)

Warnings (non-blocking, address before next launch):
  - [ ] Add alt text to 3 images (accessibility)
  - [ ] Add og:image to landing and pricing pages (SEO)
```

**Do NOT dump hundreds of lines.** Each dimension gets ONE row in the table. Details go in follow-up messages only if the user asks "tell me more about the security findings" — not upfront.

## Verdict logic

| Condition | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| All dimensions PASS | **GO** — ready to launch |
| Some WARN, zero FAIL | **GO with warnings** — launch is safe, address warnings before next milestone |
| Any FAIL | **CONDITIONAL GO** — resolve the blocking items before launch |
| 3+ FAIL or any critical security finding | **NO-GO** — significant gaps, not launch-ready |

## The 8 dimensions

### 1. Security

**What to check:**

- Run `npm audit` / `pip audit` / equivalent for dependency vulnerabilities
- Grep for hardcoded secrets, API keys, tokens (same patterns as `check-secrets.sh` but against the full codebase, not just staged files)
- Check auth flow: is there authentication? Is it using a reputable provider (Cognito, Auth0, Firebase Auth)? Are tokens stored securely (httpOnly cookies, not localStorage)?
- Check for common OWASP risks: SQL/NoSQL injection surfaces, XSS vectors (dangerouslySetInnerHTML, v-html), CSRF protection
- Check HTTPS enforcement, CORS configuration, security headers

**PASS if:** no critical vulns, auth uses a reputable provider, no hardcoded secrets, basic OWASP surface clean.
**WARN if:** medium vulns in dependencies, or missing security headers.
**FAIL if:** critical vuln, hardcoded secrets found, no auth on a user-facing app, or obvious injection surface.

### 2. Accessibility

**What to check:**

- Grep for `<img` tags without `alt` attributes
- Check for semantic HTML: `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Check for `aria-label` on interactive elements without visible text
- Check color contrast: look for low-contrast color combinations in CSS/theme files
- Check keyboard navigation: are there `onClick` handlers without corresponding `onKeyDown`?
- Check for `<html lang="...">` attribute

**PASS if:** all images have alt text, semantic HTML used, no obvious contrast issues.
**WARN if:** a few missing alt texts, or minor semantic gaps.
**FAIL if:** systematic missing alt text, no semantic HTML at all, or no lang attribute.

### 3. Compliance

**What to check:**

- Cookie consent: grep for cookie-consent libraries (cookieconsent, react-cookie-consent, etc.) or a consent banner component
- Privacy policy: check for a `/privacy` route or `privacy-policy` page
- Terms of service: check for a `/terms` route
- GDPR: if the app collects user data, is there a data deletion mechanism? Check for a "delete account" route or endpoint
- Data retention: is there a documented policy? (Can be in docs/ or in the privacy policy)

**PASS if:** cookie consent present, privacy policy exists, terms exist.
**WARN if:** privacy policy exists but no data deletion mechanism.
**FAIL if:** no cookie consent on a site that uses cookies, or no privacy policy on a user-facing app.

### 4. Analytics

**What to check:**

- Grep for analytics SDK initialization (Google Analytics/GA4, Mixpanel, Amplitude, PostHog, Plausible)
- Check for event tracking calls (gtag, track, capture, etc.)
- Check for a config file or environment variable pointing to an analytics dashboard
- If no analytics at all and the project is user-facing: that's a finding

**PASS if:** analytics SDK configured and events are being tracked.
**WARN if:** SDK configured but few/no custom events (only page views).
**FAIL if:** user-facing app with zero analytics. (Non-user-facing like CLIs/libraries: auto-PASS.)

### 5. SEO

**What to check:**

- Check for `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` on key pages
- Check for `<meta property="og:title">`, `og:description`, `og:image` (Open Graph)
- Check for `sitemap.xml` at the expected location
- Check for `robots.txt`
- Check for canonical URLs (`<link rel="canonical">`)
- Check for structured data (JSON-LD, schema.org)

**PASS if:** title + description + OG tags on main pages, sitemap exists, robots.txt exists.
**WARN if:** missing OG tags on some pages, or no structured data.
**FAIL if:** no title/description on the main page, or no robots.txt. (Non-web projects: auto-PASS.)

### 6. Performance

**What to check:**

- If there's a build output: check bundle size (look for `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`)
- Check for image optimization: are images served as WebP/AVIF? Are there large unoptimized images (> 500KB)?
- Check for lazy loading on below-the-fold images (`loading="lazy"`)
- Check for code splitting (dynamic imports, React.lazy)
- If there's a Lighthouse config or Web Vitals tracking: check the targets

**PASS if:** bundle under 300KB gzipped, images optimized, lazy loading present.
**WARN if:** bundle 300-500KB, or a few large images.
**FAIL if:** bundle > 1MB, or systematically unoptimized images. (Non-web: auto-PASS.)

### 7. Monitoring

**What to check:**

- Grep for error tracking SDK (Sentry, Datadog, Bugsnag, LogRocket)
- Check for a health check endpoint (`/health`, `/healthz`, `/api/health`)
- Check for alerting configuration (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, CloudWatch Alarms, or alerting rules in code)
- Check for a runbook or incident response doc (`docs/runbook.md`, `docs/incident-response.md`)
- Check for logging configuration (structured logging, log levels)

**PASS if:** error tracking configured, health endpoint exists, some alerting in place.
**WARN if:** error tracking but no health endpoint, or no runbook.
**FAIL if:** no error tracking at all on a production app, or no health endpoint.

### 8. Documentation

**What to check:**

- README.md exists and is not the default template
- README has: project description, setup instructions, how to run locally, how to deploy
- API documentation: if there's an API, is it documented? (OpenAPI spec, Swagger, or doc comments)
- Deployment guide: how to deploy to staging/production
- Changelog: is there a CHANGELOG.md or are releases documented?
- Check for staleness: compare README last-modified date with recent code changes

**PASS if:** README has setup + run + deploy instructions, and was updated recently.
**WARN if:** README exists but is stale (> 30 days behind code changes), or API undocumented.
**FAIL if:** no README, or README is the default GitHub template.

## Process

### Step 1: Determine the project

If invoked with an argument, use that path. Otherwise, use the current working directory. Verify it's a git repo with source code (not the ops repo itself — the launch check is for managed projects, not for apexyard).

### Step 2: Quick scan

Read the project's structure to determine what checks apply:

- Is it a web app? (has `index.html`, React/Vue/Svelte/Next.js markers) → all 8 dimensions
- Is it an API only? (has routes/endpoints but no frontend) → skip accessibility, SEO, performance (auto-PASS)
- Is it a CLI/library? → skip accessibility, compliance, analytics, SEO, performance (auto-PASS on those)
- Is it a mobile app? → adjust accessibility checks for mobile, skip SEO

### Step 3: Run each applicable dimension

Go through each dimension in order. For each:

1. Run the checks listed above (grep, file existence, SDK detection)
2. Classify as PASS / WARN / FAIL based on the criteria
3. Write a one-line finding for the table

**Do NOT spend more than 30 seconds per dimension.** The checks should be quick grepping and file scanning, not deep code review. Deep dives happen in follow-up ("tell me more about X") not in the initial sweep.

### Step 4: Compile the verdict

Count PASS/WARN/FAIL, apply the verdict logic, format the output table.

### Step 5: Output

Print the table exactly as shown in the "Output format" section above. Then continue to Step 6 to persist the run and render the trend section.

**Do NOT auto-create tickets for the findings.** Offer: "Want me to create tickets for the blocking items?" — but let the user decide. The launch check is advisory.

### Step 6: Persist the run + render the trend

After the verdict table, persist this run to the project's history store and append a trend section if there are ≥ 2 prior runs.

#### 6a. Resolve the project's launch-check directory

Use the portfolio helper to resolve the projects dir — do NOT hardcode `projects/`:

```bash
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-read-config.sh"
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-portfolio-paths.sh"
projects_dir=$(portfolio_projects_dir)
lc_dir="$projects_dir/<project-name>/launch-check"
runs_dir="$lc_dir/runs"
mkdir -p "$runs_dir"
```

`<project-name>` is the project's registered name in `apexyard.projects.yaml`. If the project isn't registered (e.g. someone runs `/launch-check` on a directory that's never been onboarded), use the basename of the project path; tell the user the project should be `/handover`'d into the registry to make the trend persistent across machines.

#### 6b. Write the per-run JSON

Schema (apexyard#183):

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-05-08T19:30:00Z",
  "branch": "main",
  "commit": "abc1234",
  "scores": {
    "security": 88,
    "accessibility": 94,
    "compliance": 76,
    "analytics": 90,
    "seo": 87,
    "performance": 68,
    "monitoring": 83,
    "docs": 91
  },
  "verdict": "conditional-go",
  "top_risks": ["No cookie consent banner", "Missing /health endpoint"]
}
```

- `ts` — ISO-8601 UTC. Used for chronological sort.
- `branch` / `commit` — `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` and `git rev-parse --short HEAD` from the project's working tree.
- `scores.*` — 0..100 per dimension. Map PASS → 95 ± project-specific finding-density, WARN → 70..85, FAIL → 30..55. Use your judgement based on the finding's severity. The headline score is the unweighted mean — adopters who want weighting can post-process.
- `verdict` — one of `go`, `go-with-warnings`, `conditional-go`, `no-go`.
- `top_risks` — the same blocking items you listed in the human-readable output.

Write the file at `<runs_dir>/<ts>.json` with the timestamp safely encoded for filesystems (replace `:` with `-`, e.g. `2026-05-08T19-30-00Z.json`).

**Forward-compatibility note:** the schema is open. Future framework versions may add fields (e.g. `notes`, `actor`, `weighting`); the trend renderer reads only `ts`, `scores`, `verdict`, so older run files continue to render correctly after framework upgrades.

#### 6c. Render the trend section

Run the trend renderer:

```bash
"$SKILL_DIR/render-trend.sh" "$runs_dir" 5
```

- With < 2 runs in the dir → prints nothing, exits 0. Skip the trend section in this run's output (this is correct on a project's first run).
- With ≥ 2 runs → prints the trend markdown block (heading + table + ASCII chart) to stdout. Append it to this run's per-run summary markdown at `<lc_dir>/<ts>.md` and to the chat output.

The `notes` column is auto-derived from the score-delta vs the previous run (e.g. "Security +12, Performance +5"). The most-recent row appends "(this run)". Operator-supplied notes are v2; v1 is auto-derived only.

#### 6d. Opt-in commit (history-tracked marker)

By default, history JSON files are gitignored. Most adopters do not want history bloat in the repo.

Operator opt-in: a presence-only marker file at `<lc_dir>/.launch-check-history-tracked` flips this. When the marker exists, the skill emits a `.gitignore` for `<runs_dir>/` that *un-ignores* `*.json` files; when absent, the runs dir is fully gitignored.

Concretely on first persist:

- If `<lc_dir>/.launch-check-history-tracked` exists:
  - Ensure `<lc_dir>/.gitignore` does NOT block runs JSON (delete or comment any `runs/` exclusion).
- Otherwise:
  - Ensure `<lc_dir>/.gitignore` contains `runs/` so JSON files don't accidentally get committed.

Either way, leave it for the operator to `git add` when they want history committed; never auto-commit. The skill is read-only with respect to the working tree's commit state.

To opt-in to committing history (for a project whose readiness trend the team wants archived in the repo):

```bash
touch projects/<name>/launch-check/.launch-check-history-tracked
```

To opt back out, delete the marker.

## Trend-only mode — `/launch-check trend [project-path]`

Read-only mode that produces just the trend section (no full audit, no per-dimension grep). Useful for "are we trending up?" without re-running the costly sweep.

Process:

1. Resolve the project's launch-check dir (same as Step 6a).
2. If `<runs_dir>` doesn't exist or has < 2 JSON files, tell the operator there's no trend yet (run `/launch-check` first to establish baseline + at least one comparison point).
3. Otherwise, run `render-trend.sh "$runs_dir" 5` and print the output.

Do NOT run the 8-dimension sweep in this mode. Do NOT write any new JSON. This mode is purely for reviewing existing history.

## Rules

1. **Scannable in 10 seconds.** One table, one verdict, one blockers list. No walls of text.
2. **One row per dimension.** Details on demand, not upfront.
3. **30 seconds per dimension.** Quick grep and file scanning, not deep code review.
4. **Auto-PASS non-applicable dimensions.** A CLI doesn't need a cookie banner.
5. **Advisory, not blocking.** The user decides go/no-go based on the findings. The skill does NOT block deploys mechanically.
6. **Don't create tickets unprompted.** Offer to create them. Let the user decide.
7. **Run from the project directory.** The skill checks `workspace/<project>/`, not the ops repo.
8. **Persist every run.** Step 6 always writes a JSON file under the project's `launch-check/runs/` (regardless of opt-in commit state). The `.launch-check-history-tracked` marker only controls whether those files are committed; it does NOT control whether they are written.
9. **Resolve paths via the portfolio helper.** Don't hardcode `projects/` — adopters in split-portfolio mode have a different projects dir. Use `portfolio_projects_dir` from `_lib-portfolio-paths.sh`.

## Implementation notes

The persistence + trend logic ships as a small shell helper alongside this SKILL:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `render-trend.sh` | Reads `<runs_dir>` for `*.json` files, sorts by `ts`, emits the trend markdown block (heading + table + ASCII chart). Exits silently with no output when < 2 runs exist. |

Design rationale (ASCII chart vs Mermaid, JSON schema choice, opt-in commit marker): see [`docs/agdr/AgDR-0014-launch-check-trend-tracking.md`](../../../docs/agdr/AgDR-0014-launch-check-trend-tracking.md).
