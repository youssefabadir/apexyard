# /docs-audit — Documentation Completeness (Diataxis)

Deep-dive documentation analysis using the Diataxis framework. Checks that docs cover all four quadrants (tutorials, how-to guides, reference, explanation) and are not stale. Invoke when `/launch-check`'s documentation row shows WARN or FAIL.

## Diataxis Framework

| Quadrant | Purpose | What to look for |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Tutorials** | Learning-oriented, guided first steps | Getting started guide, quickstart, "Hello World" |
| **How-to guides** | Goal-oriented, solving specific problems | Deployment guide, migration guide, troubleshooting |
| **Reference** | Information-oriented, accurate description | API docs, config reference, CLI flags, environment variables |
| **Explanation** | Understanding-oriented, why things work | Architecture overview, design decisions (AgDRs), ADRs |

## Process

### Step 1: README quality

Check `README.md` for these sections (each is pass/fail):

| Section | Present? | Quality check |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Project description | | One paragraph explaining what this is and who it's for |
| Prerequisites | | Language version, tools needed, accounts required |
| Quick start | | Copy-pasteable commands to get running locally in < 5 minutes |
| Development setup | | How to set up the dev environment, run tests, lint |
| Deployment | | How to deploy to staging and production |
| Contributing | | How to contribute (branch naming, PR process, code standards) |
| License | | License type and link |

### Step 2: API documentation (if applicable)

- Check for OpenAPI / Swagger spec (`openapi.yaml`, `swagger.json`)
- Check for auto-generated docs (Swagger UI, Redoc, tsdoc, typedoc)
- Check if endpoints in the code match the spec (any undocumented endpoints?)
- Check for example requests and responses

### Step 3: Operational docs

- Deployment guide: how to deploy, what environment variables are needed
- Runbook: what to do when things go wrong (overlap with `/monitoring-audit`)
- Changelog: is there a CHANGELOG.md? Are releases documented?
- Architecture overview: high-level diagram or description of components
- AgDRs/ADRs: are technical decisions documented?

### Step 4: Staleness detection

- Compare `README.md` last-modified date with recent code changes
- Check if API docs mention endpoints/features that no longer exist
- Check if environment variable docs list vars that are no longer used
- Flag docs that reference deprecated tools, libraries, or patterns

### Step 5: Output

```
DOCS AUDIT — <project> @ <sha>

Diataxis coverage:
  Tutorials:   ✓ getting-started.md exists
  How-to:      ✓ deployment guide, ✗ migration guide, ✗ troubleshooting
  Reference:   ✓ OpenAPI spec (28 endpoints), ✗ env vars undocumented
  Explanation: ✓ 3 AgDRs, ✗ no architecture overview

| # | Area | Status | Finding |
|----|------|--------|---------|
| D1 | README | WARN | Missing "Contributing" section |
| D2 | API docs | PASS | OpenAPI spec matches code (28/28 endpoints) |
| D3 | Env vars | FAIL | 12 env vars in .env.example, 0 documented in README |
| D4 | Changelog | PASS | CHANGELOG.md updated with last 5 releases |
| D5 | Staleness | WARN | README references "Express" but code migrated to Fastify 3 months ago |

Documentation readiness: PARTIAL (1 fail, 2 warnings)
```

## Persist the run + render trend

After printing the findings table, persist via the shared audit-history lib so the docs trend across runs becomes legible. See `docs/agdr/AgDR-0019-audit-artefact-persistence.md`.

### Resolve project name + score + verdict

`<project-name>` from `apexyard.projects.yaml` (or basename + `/handover` reminder if unregistered).

Score: `score = max(0, 100 - 25*critical - 10*high - 3*medium - 1*low)`. Verdict by worst-severity: critical/high → `fail`, medium → `conditional`, low/none → `pass`. Legacy "Documentation readiness" three-state: PARTIAL → `conditional`, MISSING → `fail`, COMPLETE → `pass`.

### Persist + render

```bash
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/_lib-audit-history.sh"

# Lowercase severity in the payload — the lib expects critical/high/medium/low/info.
payload=$(mktemp); cat > "$payload" <<'EOF'
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "findings": [
    {"id": "D2", "severity": "high",   "status": "open", "summary": "No docs/how-to/ dir; recipes scattered in Slack"},
    {"id": "D3", "severity": "high",   "status": "open", "summary": "Env vars not documented in README (12 in .env.example)"},
    {"id": "D5", "severity": "medium", "status": "open", "summary": "README references Express; code migrated to Fastify 3 months ago"}
  ]
}
EOF

# Body: per templates/audits/docs-audit.md (Diataxis quadrants + README + staleness)
body=$(mktemp); cat > "$body" <<'EOF'
... (filled-in body — Diataxis groupings + README quality + staleness + Recommended priority) ...
EOF

ts=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
audit_run_persist "<project-name>" "docs-audit" "$ts" "fail" 60 "$body" < "$payload"
rm -f "$payload" "$body"

audit_render_trend "<project-name>" "docs-audit" 5
```

### Opt-in commit

```bash
touch projects/<name>/audits/docs-audit/.audit-history-tracked
```

## Rules

1. **README is the minimum.** Every project needs a README with at least: description, quick start, and how to deploy. Everything else is a "should have."
2. **Check for staleness, not just existence.** A README that exists but describes the wrong stack is worse than no README.
3. **Diataxis is a lens, not a checklist.** Don't fail a project for missing all four quadrants — most projects start with tutorials + reference and add the rest over time.
4. **Auto-PASS for the ops repo itself.** ApexYard's own docs are governed by its own process — this skill is for managed projects.
5. **Always persist via the lib.** The persist step runs regardless of opt-in commit state.
6. **Severity vocabulary in the JSON is lowercase.** The lib expects `critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`/`info`.
