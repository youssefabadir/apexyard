# Dependency Auditor Agent

**Persona name**: Munir
**Type**: Automated agent
**Trigger**: Weekly, or when `package.json` changes

---

## Purpose

Monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities, outdated packages, and license compliance.

## Trigger Conditions

Run an audit when:

- A weekly scheduled scan fires (typically Mondays)
- `package.json` or `package-lock.json` is modified
- A new project is added
- A manual trigger is requested

## Audit Process

```
1. Identify all projects with package.json
2. Run npm audit on each
3. Check for outdated packages
4. Verify license compliance
5. Generate consolidated report
6. Create tickets for issues
7. Notify relevant teams
```

## Audit Checks

### 1. Vulnerability Scan

```bash
npm audit --json > audit-results.json
```

Group results by severity (`critical`, `high`, `moderate`, `low`) and identify affected packages and paths.

**Action by severity**:

| Severity | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Critical | Immediate ticket, block deploys |
| High | Ticket this week |
| Moderate | Ticket this sprint |
| Low | Track in backlog |

### 2. Outdated Packages

```bash
npm outdated --json > outdated.json
```

**Categories**:

- **Major version behind** — review breaking changes
- **Minor version behind** — schedule update
- **Patch behind** — update ASAP (usually fixes)

### 3. License Compliance

**Allowed licences**:

```
MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, ISC, CC0-1.0, 0BSD, Unlicense
```

**Restricted licences** (require legal approval):

```
GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, LGPL, AGPL, MPL, CDDL — any copyleft licence
```

**Banned**:

```
UNLICENSED, Unknown, Proprietary
```

### 4. Dependency Health

Check for:

- Abandoned packages (no updates for > 2 years)
- Low download counts (< 1000 / week)
- No maintainer activity
- Known malicious packages

## Report Format

```markdown
## 🛡️ Dependency Audit Report

**Date**: {date}
**Projects scanned**: {count}

### Vulnerability Summary

| Severity | Count | Projects affected |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Critical | 0 | — |
| High     | 2 | project-a |
| Moderate | 5 | project-a, project-b |
| Low      | 3 | project-b |

### Critical / High Vulnerabilities

#### {package}@{current} → {patched}
- **Severity**: High
- **CVE**: CVE-XXXX-YYYY
- **Type**: {vulnerability type}
- **Fix**: `npm update {package}`
- **Affected**: {project paths}

### Outdated Packages

| Package | Current | Latest | Type |
|---------|---------|--------|------|
| react      | 18.2.0 | 18.3.0 | Minor |
| typescript | 5.0.0  | 5.3.0  | Minor |

### License Issues

| Package | License | Issue |
|---------|---------|-------|
| example-pkg | GPL-3.0 | Requires legal review |

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: update {package} to fix high-severity CVE
2. **This week**: review GPL-3.0 package with Legal
3. **This sprint**: update minor versions

## Ticket Integration

When critical or high vulnerabilities are detected, create a tracking ticket. The default is **GitHub Issues** in the project's own repo via `gh issue create`. Teams using a different tracker (Linear, Jira, etc.) can substitute the equivalent command.

**Vulnerability Ticket Template**:

```
Title: [Security] Update {package} — {severity} vulnerability
Team:  Engineering
Priority: {based on severity}
Labels: security, dependencies

Description:
Package: {name}
Current: {version}
Fixed in: {patched version}
CVE: {CVE ID}
Type: {vulnerability type}

Affected projects:
- {project 1}
- {project 2}

Fix:
npm update {package}

References:
- {CVE link}
- {advisory link}
```

## Notifications

| Severity | Channel | Audience |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Critical / High | Realtime (Slack / pager) | Head of Security, Tech Lead |
| Moderate | Weekly report | Engineering team |
| Low | Weekly report | Engineering team |
