# SessionStart hook: shows a one-line banner when a new tagged release
# exists on upstream me2resh/apexyard that the fork doesn't yet have.
#
# Tag-based drift (new in v1.1.0): small main commits (README typos, CI
# tweaks, docs-only PRs) do NOT fire the banner. Only a new upstream tag
# does. This keeps the signal actionable and avoids training fork owners
# to tune out the banner over time.
#
# Fallback: if upstream has NEVER been tagged (brand-new project, pre-
# release), or the fork has never merged any upstream tag, fall back to
# commit-count drift so newly-forked users still get useful guidance.
#
# Silent exit paths (no output, no error):
#   - Not a git repo
#   - No `upstream` remote configured (this is the upstream repo itself,
#     or the fork hasn't set up `upstream` yet — /setup reminds them)
#   - Fetch fails (offline, git hosting down, permission)
#   - Fork is up-to-date on the latest upstream tag
#   - No upstream tags AND no commit drift
#
# Banner emits only when there's something actionable: a new upstream tag
# the fork hasn't merged, OR (in fallback mode) commits behind main.
#
# Fetch caching: the hook hits the network at most once per 10 minutes per
# clone. A tight-loop of sessions (IDE restarts, `claude --resume`) doesn't
# hammer origin. Cache lives at .claude/session/last-upstream-fetch — session
# state, already gitignored.
#
# Runtime: < 200ms on cache hit, 1-3s on cache miss (depends on fetch latency).
