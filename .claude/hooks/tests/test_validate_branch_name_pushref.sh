# Tests for validate-branch-name.sh's push-source-ref extraction (#194, #547).
#
# Validates that the hook reads the branch from the actual `git push`
# command's source ref when present, rather than from `git branch
# --show-current` against the harness's $PWD. This is the worktree-safe
# behaviour Agent fan-out workers depend on.
#
# Also validates the #547 bug fixes:
#   - `HEAD:dst` refspec → validates DST, not HEAD (was: blocked on "HEAD")
#   - `--tags 2>&1 | tail` → skipped as tag push (was: blocked on "2>")
#   - shell redirections stripped before token parsing
#
# Each case:
#   - builds an isolated sandbox with the hook + helper
#   - sets the sandbox to a "wrong" local branch that, if used, would FAIL
#     validation (so we know the hook used the push-ref, not local HEAD)
#   - pipes a synthetic PreToolUse JSON for a `git push` command containing
#     the branch we actually want validated
#   - asserts exit code (0 = pass, 2 = blocked)
#
# Exit 0 if all cases pass; 1 on first failure.

#
# Scenario: from an ops-fork session whose cwd branch is non-conforming
# (`dev` / a bogus host branch), the operator runs
#   `cd <other-repo> && git push origin`
# with NO explicit source ref. The hook fires BEFORE the shell `cd` runs,
# so its cwd is still the host sandbox. Pre-#693 the fallback resolves the
# branch via `git branch --show-current` in the host cwd (non-conforming →
# false BLOCK, e.g. "Branch 'dev' missing ticket ID"). Post-#693 the hook
# re-roots the fallback to the cd-target via pr_cmd_cd_target.
#
# These cases need a SECOND repo (the cd-target) checked out on a known
# branch, while the host sandbox stays on the non-conforming branch.

# Build a target repo checked out on the given branch. Echoes its path.
