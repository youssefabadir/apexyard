# Tests for pr_base_repo (+ its interaction with review_marker_path) in
# _lib-review-markers.sh — the cross-fork approval-marker fix (me2resh/apexyard#765).
#
# pr_base_repo resolves a PR's BASE repo (the canonical marker key) by parsing the
# PR URL, falling back to a hint when base == head or gh fails. The discriminating
# assertions prove: (a) cross-fork keys on BASE, (b) same-repo is UNCHANGED.
#
# gh is mocked via a file-driven stub (no env-export subtleties): the stub prints
# the contents of $MOCKBIN/url, or exits non-zero when that file is empty.
#
# The stub is --repo-AWARE (me2resh/apexyard#770 review): a `gh pr view --repo <r>`
# call only resolves when <r> is the BASE repo in the queued URL; scoping to any
# other repo (e.g. the fork on a cross-fork PR) fails exactly like real gh rejecting
# a base-numbered PR looked up on the fork. This makes the cross-fork case below
# LOAD-BEARING: it fails if pr_base_repo ever re-introduces `--repo "$hint"` scoping
# (the query MUST be unscoped) and passes only when the base is genuinely resolved.
