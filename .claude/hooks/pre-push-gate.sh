# pre-push-gate.sh — blocks `git push` on red local checks.
#
# Upgraded from an advisory reminder (pre-#111) to a blocking check-runner:
# reads a list of shell commands from `.claude/project-config.*.json`
# (`.pre_push.commands`) and runs them in sequence before the push is
# allowed through. Non-zero exit from any command blocks the push.
#
# This implements the HARD STOP documented in `.claude/rules/pr-workflow.md`
# — "Never push without running CI checks locally." Previously the rule
# was self-discipline; now it's mechanical.
#
# Silent pass conditions (exit 0, no output):
#   - Not a `git push` command.
#   - No `.claude/project-config.defaults.json` AND no `package.json` in the
#     repo → treat as a non-runnable repo (docs-only, newly-forked, etc.).
#   - HEAD commit subject contains the skip marker `<!-- pre-push: skip -->`
#     → emergency escape hatch; prints a visible WARN and lets the push
#     through. Leaves a grep-able trace so bypasses are auditable.
#
# Configured commands (example, from the shipped defaults):
#   - lint:      npm run lint
#   - typecheck: npm run typecheck
#   - test:      npm run test
#   - build:     npm run build
#
# Skip marker: include the literal string `<!-- pre-push: skip -->` in the
# HEAD commit message (subject or body) to bypass for that one push.
# The hook prints the bypassed command set to stderr so the skip is visible.

The skip marker is grep-able on purpose — bypasses should be rare and
auditable. See .claude/rules/pr-workflow.md "Before git push (HARD STOP)".
