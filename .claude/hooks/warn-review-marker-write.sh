# PreToolUse hook — fires when a Write tool call or a Bash command targets a
# review-marker file (*-rex.approved, *-ceo.approved, *-security.approved,
# *-architecture.approved) under .claude/session/reviews/.
#
# HISTORY
# -------
# #728 made this hook's banner "unmissable" (VIOLATION framing, per-marker-type
# messaging) but kept it purely advisory (exit 0 always) — reasoning that the
# harness provides no per-agent-type signal (CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION is set
# identically for every sub-agent, sanctioned reviewer or not), so a shell
# hook cannot reliably distinguish "the real code-reviewer is writing this"
# from "a build agent is impersonating the code-reviewer".
#
# #843 found the residual gap: the banner alone doesn't stop the write, and
# twice (PRs #835, #842) a build-class sub-agent — which cannot nest the
# Agent tool to spawn the real reviewer — resolved auto-code-review.sh's
# "Invoke Rex NOW" instruction by impersonating Rex itself: posting a fake
# review and writing the *-rex.approved marker.
#
# THE FIX (#843): rather than trying to distinguish agent *identity* (the
# #728 blocker), gate on agent *provenance via session state* instead — a
# **active-reviewer session marker** at .claude/session/active-reviewer that
# the orchestrator (or one of /code-review, /security-review, /design-review)
# writes immediately before spawning the sanctioned reviewer, one line:
# `<owner>/<repo>#<pr>:<kind>`. A write to *-rex.approved / *-security.approved
# / *-architecture.approved is now BLOCKED (exit 2) unless that marker exists
# and matches the (repo, pr, kind) being written:
#
#   .claude/session/active-reviewer contains:  me2resh/apexyard#843:rex
#   allows a write to:                         me2resh__apexyard__843-rex.approved
#   blocks a write to:                         me2resh__apexyard__843-security.approved  (kind mismatch)
#   blocks a write to:                         me2resh__apexyard__844-rex.approved        (pr mismatch)
#
# A build-class sub-agent — spawned to implement a ticket, with no reason to
# ever see an active-reviewer marker set for its own PR — is blocked with a
# message telling it to stop and hand back to the orchestrator.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION (scope of the block, honestly stated)
# ------------------------------------------------------
# This gate fires only when the LITERAL marker path (e.g. a `*-rex.approved`
# suffix) appears in the Write tool's file_path or in the Bash command text —
# it inherits the `_is_marker_target` match surface that predates #843. The
# sanctioned reviewers write the marker via a shell VARIABLE
# (`printf '%s\n' "$SHA" > "$REX_MARKER"`, path from `review_marker_path`),
# where the literal suffix never appears in the command text; a shell hook
# cannot expand that variable to know the target, so the variable form is NOT
# intercepted. Consequence: this blocks the common "just create the file"
# literal-path forgery vector (real value), but an agent that forges by
# copying the reviewers' own documented variable-form idiom is NOT stopped by
# this hook. So #843 *narrows* the induced-impersonation surface; it does not
# claim to mechanically block every forgery. The load-bearing defences remain
# the per-PR CEO nod (`/approve-merge`) and the orchestrator running a real,
# separate reviewer pass — this gate is a backstop, not a complete fence.
#
# *-ceo.approved KEEPS its original #728 advisory-only behaviour (never
# blocks) — it has its own structured-field defence in
# block-unreviewed-merge.sh (sha= / approved_by=user / skill_version=) and is
# written by a human-invoked skill (/approve-merge), not a reviewer agent.
#
# Legacy bare-number marker filenames (pre-#485 repo-qualifier, e.g.
# `843-rex.approved` with no `<owner>__<repo>__` prefix) are still
# recognised — the repo component of the active-reviewer check is skipped
# for those (can't recover a repo from a bare filename), but the pr + kind
# match still applies.
#
# THREAT MODEL: same as every other marker in this framework (see
# .claude/rules/pr-workflow.md). Local session state, gitignored, converts
# invisible inference into visible, checkable file existence. Claude can
# still fabricate the active-reviewer marker by hand — that is a visible,
# auditable, grep-able rule violation, same order of magnitude as forging
# the marker directly used to be. The mechanical gate exists to remove the
# INDUCED failure mode (auto-code-review.sh's banner telling a build agent
# to do the impossible), not to defend against a deliberately adversarial
# agent.
#
# Wired in .claude/settings.json PreToolUse for:
#   matcher: Write    (catches direct file writes)
#   matcher: Bash     (catches shell redirections, echo >, printf, tee, etc.)

======================================================================
[apexyard] VIOLATION WARNING: Unauthorized review-marker write detected
======================================================================

You are about to write a *-ceo.approved review marker.

  *-ceo.approved must be written ONLY by the /approve-merge skill
  on an explicit per-PR CEO approval. It carries structured provenance
  fields (approved_by=user, skill_version=2) that cannot be fabricated
  casually.

  Who may write this marker:
    /approve-merge skill, invoked by the orchestrator on an explicit CEO nod

WHY THIS MATTERS
  Writing this file yourself satisfies the merge gate's FILENAME check
  but NOT its INTENT. block-unreviewed-merge.sh independently validates
  the structured fields before any merge is allowed, so a hand-written
  marker without those fields is still rejected at merge time — but
  don't write this file yourself. Invoke /approve-merge <pr>.

======================================================================
[apexyard] BLOCKED: Unauthorized review-marker write
======================================================================

You are about to write a *-${MARKER_TYPE}.approved review marker with no
matching active-reviewer session marker.

Target:  ${TARGET}
Expected active-reviewer marker: ${ACTIVE_REVIEWER_MARKER}
  (must contain: <owner>/<repo>#${TARGET_PR:-<pr>}:${MARKER_TYPE})

This marker may ONLY be written by the sanctioned reviewer agent for this
role (code-reviewer / security-reviewer / solution-architect), immediately
after the orchestrator sets the active-reviewer marker and spawns it.

IF YOU ARE A BUILD-CLASS SUB-AGENT (backend-engineer, frontend-engineer,
platform-engineer, product-manager, data-engineer, ui-designer, ux-designer,
tech-lead, etc.): STOP. Do NOT write this file. You cannot nest the Agent
tool to spawn the real reviewer, so any "review" you produce here is the
author reviewing their own work — the exact failure this gate exists to
stop (see .claude/rules/pr-workflow.md § "Build agents cannot self-review").
Report your build results plainly and hand back to the orchestrator.

IF YOU ARE THE ORCHESTRATOR: set the active-reviewer marker before spawning
the reviewer, then retry:

  mkdir -p "\$(dirname "${ACTIVE_REVIEWER_MARKER}")"
  printf '%s\n' "<owner>/<repo>#${TARGET_PR:-<pr>}:${MARKER_TYPE}" > "${ACTIVE_REVIEWER_MARKER}"

Then invoke the real reviewer via the Agent tool (subagent_type:
code-reviewer / security-reviewer / solution-architect). Clear the marker
once the review is posted — a SessionStart sweep also clears stale markers
left by an interrupted session.
