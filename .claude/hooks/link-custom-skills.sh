# link-custom-skills.sh — SessionStart hook
#
# Surfaces company-private custom skills (stored in the split-portfolio
# private sibling repo at <private>/custom-skills/<name>/) to Claude Code
# via the public fork's .claude/skills/ discovery path.
#
# Implementation: gitignored symlinks at .claude/skills/<name>/ pointing to
# <private>/custom-skills/<name>/. Claude Code's skill discovery walks
# .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md, so the symlink makes the private skill
# transparently visible without copying or moving anything.
#
# Behaviour summary (advisory hook — exit 0 always; this is plumbing, not
# a gate):
#
#   - No private custom-skills dir resolved or directory missing → no-op,
#     silent. Single-fork adopters and split-portfolio adopters who haven't
#     created custom-skills/ yet see nothing.
#   - For each subdirectory under <private>/custom-skills/<name>/ that
#     contains SKILL.md, ensure a symlink exists at .claude/skills/<name>.
#       * If a framework skill of the same name exists at .claude/skills/<name>
#         AS A REAL DIRECTORY (not a symlink we created previously), the custom
#         skill WINS — we replace it with the symlink and emit a one-line
#         visible warning naming the override.
#       * If the existing entry is already a symlink to the same target, no-op.
#       * If the existing entry is a symlink to a different target, replace
#         it (operator may have changed the private dir).
#   - On Windows: decline gracefully — print a one-line manual-install
#     pointer and skip. Mirrors the LSP-on-Windows behaviour from /setup.
#
# All output goes to stderr so it shows up in the SessionStart banner stream
# without polluting stdout that other hooks/skills might consume.
