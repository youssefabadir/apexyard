# That fallback MUST be resolved against the repo the command actually runs
# in — not the hook's own cwd. The harness fires this PreToolUse hook BEFORE
# the shell executes the command, so a `cd <repo> && git push …` prefix has
# NOT yet changed the working dir: the hook's cwd is still the ops fork (on,
# e.g., `dev`). Without re-rooting, the fallback reads the ops-fork's branch
# and false-blocks a push for a *different* managed repo (e.g. "Branch 'dev'
# missing ticket ID"). Same class as #669/#687 for the merge gates + arch-PR
# hook. See me2resh/apexyard#693.
#
# Re-root via pr_cmd_cd_target from _lib-pr-repo.sh: if the command begins
# with `cd <path> && …`, resolve the fallback branch with `git -C <path>`.
# When there's no leading `cd` (or <path> isn't a git tree), this is a no-op

BLOCKED: Branch '$CURRENT_BRANCH' doesn't follow naming convention.

Required shape (.claude/rules/git-conventions.md § "Branch Naming"):
  {type}/{TICKET-ID}-{description}

Accepted types: ${TYPES//|/, }
  (configurable: .claude/project-config.*.json → .branch.type_whitelist)

Accepted ticket-ID pattern: ${INNER_PATTERN}
  (configurable: .claude/project-config.*.json → .tracker.id_pattern)

Examples:
  feature/ABC-123-add-auth
  fix/GH-45-login-bug
  docs/ENG-99-update-readme

To unblock:
  1. Pick a ticket-ID (existing or new): /feature, /task, /bug
  2. Pick a short kebab-case description (max ~40 chars)
  3. Rename the current branch in place:
       git branch -m "$CURRENT_BRANCH" "feature/GH-XX-your-description"
     OR start fresh from the project's integration branch (most
     managed projects are trunk-based on 'main'; the apexyard framework
     itself uses 'dev' — pick the one that matches THIS repo):
       git checkout main && git checkout -b "feature/GH-XX-your-description"
  4. Retry the operation

If the current branch has commits you want to keep, the rename in
step 3 preserves them — the branch keeps its history, just gains a
new name.
