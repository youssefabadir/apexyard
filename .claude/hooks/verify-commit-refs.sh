# PreToolUse hook on `git commit -m / -F`: scans the commit message for
# issue references (Closes #N, Refs #N, Fixes #N, Resolves #N, Related to #N)
# and blocks the commit if any reference points at an issue that doesn't
# exist in the tracker repo.
#
# Backstop for the ticket-vocabulary rule (.claude/rules/ticket-vocabulary.md).
# The primary enforcement is self-discipline: never use tracker notation for
# plan items that have no real issue behind them. This hook catches the
# downstream symptom — a fabricated #N that made it into a commit message
# on its way to becoming durable history.
#
# Interactive commits (no -m / -F) are NOT checked. Parsing .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
# before the editor opens would race with git's own validation, and Claude
# rarely uses the interactive path anyway. Accepted gap.
#
# Tracker repo resolves in this order:
#   1. .claude/project-config.json `.tracker_repo`
#   2. origin remote (parsed from `git remote get-url origin`)
#
# Upstream awareness (me2resh/apexyard#207): when an `upstream` remote is
# configured (typical fork-of-apexyard layout), a #N reference that misses in
# the primary tracker is rechecked against `upstream` before being declared
# missing. This lets a fork's `Closes #150` validate when issue 150 lives on
# the upstream repo — and, more importantly, lets GitHub's auto-close fire on
# merge (auto-close requires BARE #N notation; the cross-repo workaround
# `Closes owner/repo#150` passes the hook but breaks auto-close).
#
# Short-circuit: try the primary tracker first, only fall back to upstream on
# miss. No double query for refs that resolve in origin.

# IMPORTANT: Claude and humans both commonly use multi-line -m arguments via

# the literal -m value spans multiple lines in the command string. `sed -nE`
# processes stdin line-by-line by default, so a regex like `-m "([^"]*)"`
# cannot span lines and silently fails to match.
#
# Fix: flatten the command string with `tr '\n' ' '` before sed processing.
# The message then parses as a single logical line. The ref-pattern grep
# below doesn't care about line breaks either way.

# which is the default shape for Claude-generated commits. Confirmed via

This is the failure mode the ticket-vocabulary rule exists to prevent — do NOT
use tracker notation (Closes #N, Refs #N, etc.) for plan items that have no
real issue behind them. See .claude/rules/ticket-vocabulary.md.

If you intended to reference a real issue, verify the number(s).
If you were about to commit work that has no ticket yet, create one first:
  gh issue create --repo ${TRACKER_REPO} --title "..."
and use the returned number in your commit message.

If the reference is truly informational (cross-repo link that can't be verified
with \`gh issue view\`), write it as a plain URL instead of #N notation.

This commit is allowed through — a commit may legitimately reference the

PR needs its own OPEN ticket. If this commit will end up in a PR that points
at the closed issue as its primary ticket, create a new open ticket first.
