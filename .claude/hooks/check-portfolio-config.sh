# SessionStart hook: surface broken portfolio config at session start.
#
# Calls portfolio_validate() from _lib-portfolio-paths.sh and prints a
# one-line banner if the config is broken. Silent when:
#   - not inside an apexyard fork
#   - the helper or config lib is missing
#   - validate returns OK
#
# This is the self-healing banner described in #145. The intent is that an
# adopter who mistyped a path in `.claude/project-config.json` (or moved
# their sibling portfolio repo) sees the failure at session start, before
# they invoke a portfolio-aware skill that would fail with a less specific
# error.
#
# Cost on the OK path: ~10-30ms (one yq parse of the registry). Cheap
# enough to run on every SessionStart.
