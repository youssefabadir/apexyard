#
# WORKTREE-SAFE (me2resh/apexyard#549, #727)
# ------------------------------------------
# Previously both the push-check and the commit-check resolved the current
# branch via `git branch --show-current` against the hook's cwd (the harness's
# primary checkout). When the operator runs a command in a separate git worktree
# while the primary checkout sits on a protected branch, the old code
# false-blocked legitimate feature-branch work.
#
# Fix (#549):
#   Push:   reuse `_lib-extract-push-ref.sh` (already used by
#           validate-branch-name.sh for the same reason) to read the DESTINATION
#           branch directly from the push command. Tag pushes are no-ops.
#   Commit: detect the `cd <path> && git commit` shell compound pattern and run
#           `git -C <path> branch --show-current` against the TARGET worktree.
#           Falls back to the session cwd for plain `git commit` (no `cd`
#           prefix) — preserving the original behaviour for the normal case.
#
# Fix (#727) — push fallback when no explicit ref is given:
#   `git push -u origin` (and `--set-upstream`) without an explicit branch
#   name carries no refspec, so extract_push_ref() returns empty and the old
#   code fell back to `git branch --show-current` in the HOOK's session cwd.
#   In a worktree session where the primary checkout is on `dev` but the
#   active worktree is on a feature branch, this falsely blocked a legitimate
#   push.  Fix: when the ref is absent and the command has a `cd <path>`
#   prefix, resolve the current branch from that path (same pattern used by
#   the commit section above).

All changes must go through a PR (.claude/rules/git-conventions.md
§ "No Direct Main"). Protected branches: ${PROTECTED//|/, }.

To unblock:
  1. Create a feature branch from your current work:
       git checkout -b feature/GH-<ticket>-<short-description>
  2. Push the feature branch:
       git push -u origin feature/GH-<ticket>-<short-description>
  3. Open a PR via /feature → /start-ticket → gh pr create, OR if the
     ticket exists, just: gh pr create --base <protected-branch> --head <feature-branch>

Customise (rare): .claude/project-config.json → .git.protected_branches[]
REPLACES the default list (main / master / dev / develop). To REMOVE
protection from a default-protected branch (e.g. you legitimately use
'dev' as your trunk), write the array with that branch OMITTED. To ADD
protection to a new branch, write the array INCLUDING it. The hook
trusts whichever list you provide — get the direction right.

To unblock:
  1. Create a feature branch from your current state (preserves your

current commit, reset ${CURRENT_BRANCH} to drop the accidental commit
locally, then check out the recovery branch.
