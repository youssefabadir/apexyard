# PreToolUse hook on `gh pr merge` AND `gh api .../pulls/<N>/merge`: when the
# PR's diff touches UI files, require a design approval marker at
# .claude/session/reviews/<pr>-design.approved (with a matching HEAD SHA) before
# letting the merge through.
#
# Both merge shapes are covered — see _lib-extract-pr.sh for the parser and
# #47 for why the API-shape bypass was a gap worth closing.
#
# Enforces .claude/rules/pr-quality.md § "Design Review" and
# workflows/code-review.md § "UI Designer (conditional)" — which were
# prose-only until this hook shipped.
#
# What counts as "UI":
#   - *.tsx, *.jsx (React)
#   - *.vue (Vue)
#   - *.svelte (Svelte)
#   - *.css, *.scss, *.sass, *.less (styles)
#   - design-tokens.* (design systems)
#
# Projects that want a broader/narrower list can override via
# .claude/project-config.json:
#   `.ui_paths`         — REPLACE the default UI_GLOBS entirely (JSON array of regex patterns)
#   `.ui_paths_exclude` — ADDITIVE: paths matching any pattern here are removed
#                         from the touched-UI set AFTER UI_GLOBS matching. Mirrors
#                         the `migration_paths`-exclude precedent (#275).
#
# Use `ui_paths_exclude` when you want to keep the default broad matching but
# carve out a specific dir (e.g. `^docs/examples/`, `^wiki/artifacts/`) where
# `.jsx`/`.tsx` files are documentation samples rather than real UI.
#
# How the marker gets written: the design-reviewer records approval by
# writing the marker file. There is no /approve-design skill yet — the
# design reviewer writes the file manually or via a (future) skill.
#
# Trust model: same as other markers. Local session state, gitignored,
# converts invisible inference ("ah, the UI change looked fine") into
# visible file existence. For adversarial trust, use CODEOWNERS.

UI files in this diff:
$(echo "$TOUCHED_UI" | tr ' ' '\n' | sed 's/^/  /' | grep -v '^  $' | head -20)

ApexYard requires a design review on any PR that touches user-facing UI —
see .claude/rules/pr-quality.md § "Design Review (UI Changes)" and
workflows/code-review.md § "UI Designer (conditional)".

The expected approval file does not exist:
  ${APPROVAL}

To unblock:

  1. Invoke the UI Designer role (or a human designer) to review the UI changes
  2. When the designer approves, record it with the current HEAD SHA:
       mkdir -p .claude/session/reviews
       git rev-parse HEAD > .claude/session/reviews/${PR_NUMBER}-design.approved
  3. Retry the merge

To customize which file patterns count as "UI":

  \`.ui_paths\`         — REPLACE the default list entirely (JSON array of regex)
  \`.ui_paths_exclude\` — ADDITIVE carve-out: keep the broad defaults but skip
                          specific dirs (e.g. ["^docs/examples/", "^wiki/"]).
                          Useful when .jsx/.tsx files are doc samples not UI
                          (#275).

Both keys live in .claude/project-config.json.

For projects that deliberately ship UI without design review (e.g. admin tools,
internal dashboards), touch the marker file manually — that's a visible,
auditable "we decided to skip design review" artifact rather than an
invisible omission.
