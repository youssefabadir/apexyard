# Blocks Edit/Write/MultiEdit on code paths when no active ticket is set.

# Active tickets are declared by the /start-ticket skill. The marker
# layout is two-tier (apexyard#41):
#
#   ops_root/.claude/session/tickets/<project>    ← per-project, preferred
#   ops_root/.claude/session/current-ticket       ← ops-repo / fallback
#
# Resolution order for a given FILE_PATH:
#   1. If FILE_PATH is under ops_root/workspace/<project>/, look up
#      ops_root/.claude/session/tickets/<project>. If present → exempt.
#   2. Fall back to ops_root/.claude/session/current-ticket. If present →
#      exempt.
#   3. Otherwise, block with instructions.
#
# Ops root is the apexyard fork root (has both onboarding.yaml and
# apexyard.projects.yaml at the top level). It's discovered by walking
# up from the nearest git toplevel; this handles the case where an agent
# worktree or a cloned managed project lives inside the ops tree and
# would otherwise report a nested git root.
#
# Exempt paths (meta / framework / docs — no ticket required):
#   - anything under .claude/
#   - any *.md file (READMEs, CLAUDE.md, rule docs, AgDRs)
#   - anything under docs/
#   - anything under projects/*/docs/ (per-project apexyard docs)
#
# Everything else (source code, config, infra) requires a ticket marker.

BLOCKED: No active ticket set for this session.

ApexYard requires a ticket BEFORE any code changes (workflow-gates rule #3,
pre-build gate, "one ticket at a time"). To proceed:

  1. Create or find the ticket (GitHub Issue in the project's own repo):
       gh issue create --repo <owner/repo> --title "..."
  2. Declare it for this session — run the /start-ticket skill with the
     issue number (or pass owner/repo#number to pin it). The skill writes
     a per-project marker if the ticket's repo matches a registered
     managed project, otherwise falls back to the ops-level marker.
  3. Retry the edit

Markers looked up for this path (in order):
$([ -n "$PER_PROJECT_MARKER" ] && echo "  per-project:  $PER_PROJECT_MARKER")
  ops fallback: $FALLBACK_MARKER

Exempt paths (no ticket required): .claude/, docs/, projects/*/docs/, *.md
