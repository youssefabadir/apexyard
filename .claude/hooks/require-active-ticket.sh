# Active tickets are declared by the /start-ticket skill. The marker

#
#   ops_root/.claude/session/tickets/<project>/<branch>  ← per-worktree (#513)

#
# Resolution order for a given FILE_PATH under ops_root/workspace/<project>/:
#   0. If the file's repo is on a git worktree branch (or CLAUDE_WORKTREE_BRANCH
#      is set), look up tickets/<project>/<safe-branch>. If present → exempt.
#      (Lets parallel agents on the SAME project hold independent tickets.)
#   1. Look up tickets/<project> (a FILE). If present → exempt.
#   2. Fall back to current-ticket. If present → exempt.
#   3. Otherwise, block with instructions.
#
# tickets/<project> is a FILE in single-agent mode, a DIRECTORY in worktree
# mode; the `-f` tests keep tiers 0 and 1 from conflicting.
#
# Ops root is the apexyard fork root (has both onboarding.yaml and
# apexyard.projects.yaml at the top level). It's discovered by walking
# up from the nearest git toplevel; this handles the case where an agent
# worktree or a cloned managed project lives inside the ops tree and
# would otherwise report a nested git root.
#
# Exempt paths (meta / framework / docs — no ticket required):
#   - anything under .claude/
#   - any *.md file (READMEs, CLAUDE.md, rule docs, AgDRs)
#   - anything under docs/
#   - anything under projects/*/docs/ (per-project apexyard docs)
#
# Everything else (source code, config, infra) requires a ticket marker.

BLOCKED: No active ticket set for this session.

ApexYard requires a ticket BEFORE any code changes (workflow-gates rule #3,
pre-build gate, "one ticket at a time").

To unblock:

  1. Create or find the ticket (GitHub Issue in the project's own repo):
       gh issue create --repo <owner/repo> --title "..."
  2. Declare it for this session — run the /start-ticket skill with the
     issue number (or pass owner/repo#number to pin it). The skill writes
     a per-project marker if the ticket's repo matches a registered
     managed project, otherwise falls back to the ops-level marker.
  3. Retry the edit

Markers looked up for this path (in order):
$([ -n "$PER_WORKTREE_MARKER" ] && echo "  per-worktree: $PER_WORKTREE_MARKER")
$([ -n "$PER_PROJECT_MARKER" ] && echo "  per-project:  $PER_PROJECT_MARKER")
