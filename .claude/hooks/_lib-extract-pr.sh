# Shared PR-number and repo extraction for the merge-gate hooks:
#   - block-unreviewed-merge.sh
#   - require-design-review-for-ui.sh
#   - require-architecture-review.sh
#   - block-merge-on-red-ci.sh
#
# Not a hook itself (prefixed with `_lib-` so it's never wired as one). Sourced
# by the hooks above via `. "$(dirname "$0")/_lib-extract-pr.sh"`.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The merge gates originally only matched `gh pr merge <N>`. Incident (#47):
# merges via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/merge -X PUT` silently
# bypassed all three gates because neither the matcher nor the PR-number
# extraction knew about the API shape. This helper gives every gate a single,
# tested way to recognise both shapes:
#
#   1. `gh pr merge 42 --squash`                                  → PR is 42
#   2. `gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/42/merge -X PUT`            → PR is 42
#
# Any tool that edits one of the three merge hooks MUST keep calling this
# helper, not re-implement the parsing inline. That's the whole point.

# Echoes the PR number extracted from the command, or empty if none found.
# Tries (in order):
#   1. `gh api .../pulls/<N>/merge` URL path
#   2. `gh pr merge <N>` first numeric arg (strict: must be a bare integer token
#      immediately following `merge`; NOT a digit scraped from a redirection such
#      as `2>&1`, and NOT an unexpanded shell variable such as `$pr` or `$PR`).
#      When the token is a shell variable the function returns empty so the
#      caller's step-3 fallback can invoke `gh pr view`.
#   3. falls back to `gh pr view --json number` (current branch's PR)
#
# BUG #568 — root cause and fix:
#   The old step-2 span `[^|;&]*` included `2>&1` because the `&` lookahead
#   was not anchored before the pipe, causing `grep -oE '[0-9]+'` to return `2`
#   (the stderr fd number) instead of the PR number when the invocation was
#   `gh pr merge $pr --squash 2>&1 | tail -5` and `$pr` was unexpanded at hook
#   evaluation time.
#
#   Fix: strip redirection tokens from the span before the digit search, then
#   require that the first post-`merge` token is a bare integer — not a shell
#   variable, not a flag. If it is a variable or absent, return empty.

# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Hooks see the LITERAL command string, before the shell expands variables. For
# `gh pr merge $PR --repo $REPO`, the hook cannot know the real PR/repo:
#   - extract_pr_number returns empty for `$PR` (good, #568) but then falls back
#     to `gh pr view` in the CWD — checking a totally UNRELATED PR's CI.
#   - extract_repo_from_command captures the literal `$REPO`, which `gh` then
#     rejects with `expected the "[HOST/]OWNER/REPO" format`.
# Both produce misleading output and can evaluate the wrong PR. A gate that
# can't resolve its target must not guess — callers should BLOCK with a
# "re-run with literal values" message. This helper is that detector.
#
# Matches `$VAR`, `${VAR}` (the leading char after $ / ${ is a letter or _).

# Echoes the PR's HEAD SHA as reported by GitHub, or empty on failure.
#
# Why this exists (see #55): merge-gate hooks previously compared approval
# markers against `git rev-parse HEAD` (local HEAD). But `gh pr merge <N>`
# merges the PR's branch on GitHub's side, which is almost never equal to
# the local HEAD (local is usually `main` or a different feature branch).
# That meant every merge required a `gh pr checkout <N> && gh pr merge <N>`
# dance. Tedious and error-prone.
#
# This helper asks GitHub directly for the PR's HEAD via `gh pr view`.
# Works for both the `gh pr merge` and `gh api .../pulls/<N>/merge` shapes.
#
# Usage:
#   PR_HEAD=$(resolve_pr_head "$PR_NUMBER" "$CMD_REPO")
#   # Compare PR_HEAD against marker SHAs instead of git rev-parse HEAD.
#
# Failure modes (returns empty, caller should fall back):
#   - Network error / rate limit / gh auth expired
#   - PR doesn't exist (wrong number, closed, or wrong repo)
#   - GitHub API transient failure
#
# On failure the caller should fall back to `git rev-parse HEAD` with a
# visible warning — better to block a valid merge that the user can retry
# than silently allow a merge on the wrong SHA.
