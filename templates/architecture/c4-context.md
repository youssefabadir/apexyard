# System Context — {Project Name}

> **C4 Level 1** — the system and everyone/everything it talks to. Audience: everyone. One diagram per managed project.

## Diagram

```mermaid
C4Context
    title System Context for {Project Name}

    Person(user, "User", "The primary human actor — describe who this is")
    Person(admin, "Admin", "A privileged user — remove if you don't have one")

    System(main, "{Project Name}", "One-sentence description of what the system does")

    System_Ext(auth, "Auth Provider", "e.g. Auth0, Clerk, Supabase Auth")
    System_Ext(payments, "Payment Processor", "e.g. Stripe, Paddle — remove if N/A")
    System_Ext(email, "Email Provider", "e.g. Postmark, SES — remove if N/A")

    Rel(user, main, "Uses", "HTTPS")
    Rel(admin, main, "Administers", "HTTPS")
    Rel(main, auth, "Authenticates via", "OAuth / OIDC")
    Rel(main, payments, "Charges / webhooks", "HTTPS + webhook")
    Rel(main, email, "Sends transactional email", "SMTP / API")
```

## How to use this template

1. Copy this file to `docs/architecture/context.md` (for code-level diagrams inside a repo) or `projects/{name}/architecture/context.md` (for portfolio-level ApexYard docs).
2. Replace every `{Project Name}` and every placeholder in the `C4Context` block with your real system.
3. Remove external systems you don't use, add the ones you do.
4. Keep the diagram **one screen tall on GitHub**. If it doesn't fit, you're probably trying to show L2 detail in an L1 diagram — create the container diagram instead (see `c4-container.md`).
5. Commit. GitHub renders the diagram inline in the file view — no build step.

## What goes in L1 (context)

- The system (one box, your name on it)
- **People** who use the system (users, admins, operators)
- **External systems** the system depends on (auth, payments, email, third-party APIs, cloud services — at the level of "we talk to Stripe", not "the `stripe-node` client in the backend calls `stripe.charges.create`")
- Arrows showing the direction and gist of interaction

## What does NOT go in L1

- Internal containers (frontend / backend / database) — that's L2. If you find yourself drawing them here, you're conflating levels.
- Deployment topology (regions, load balancers, CDNs) — that's a separate concern. C4 doesn't cover it; use a deployment diagram elsewhere if you need one.
- Code-level details (classes, functions, database schema) — L3 or L4 if you ever need them.

## Maintenance

The L1 diagram should change maybe once or twice a year — only when the system's external relationships change (new integration, removed dependency, new class of users). If you find yourself updating it every sprint, you're probably putting L2 details in it.
