# Container Diagram — {Project Name}

> **C4 Level 2** — the system broken down into deployable/runnable containers. Audience: the dev team. One diagram per managed project; usually zoomed in from the L1 context diagram.

## Diagram

```mermaid
C4Container
    title Container Diagram for {Project Name}

    Person(user, "User", "The primary human actor")

    System_Boundary(boundary, "{Project Name}") {
        Container(web, "Web App", "Next.js / React", "Renders the UI, handles session state")
        Container(api, "API", "Node / Express (or your stack)", "Business logic, auth, orchestration")
        Container(worker, "Background Worker", "Node / BullMQ (or your stack)", "Async jobs — email, webhooks, ETL. Remove if synchronous-only.")
        ContainerDb(db, "Primary Database", "PostgreSQL", "Relational data")
        ContainerDb(cache, "Cache", "Redis", "Session + hot lookups. Remove if not used.")
    }

    System_Ext(auth, "Auth Provider", "e.g. Auth0")
    System_Ext(email, "Email Provider", "e.g. Postmark")

    Rel(user, web, "Uses", "HTTPS")
    Rel(web, api, "Calls", "HTTPS / JSON")
    Rel(api, db, "Reads / writes", "SQL")
    Rel(api, cache, "Reads / writes", "TCP")
    Rel(api, worker, "Enqueues jobs", "Redis / queue")
    Rel(worker, email, "Sends email", "API")
    Rel(api, auth, "Validates tokens", "OIDC")
```

## How to use this template

1. Copy this file to `docs/architecture/container.md` (inside a project repo) or `projects/{name}/architecture/container.md` (in the ApexYard portfolio docs).
2. Replace `{Project Name}` and every placeholder inside the `C4Container` block with your real containers.
3. A "container" in C4 terms is a **deployable / runnable unit**: a web app, a mobile app, an API, a database, a queue, a worker. It is NOT a Docker container (confusing but standard). Use the tech label to name the runtime (`Next.js`, `PostgreSQL`, `Redis`, etc.).
4. Keep it to **5–9 containers max**. More than that and you're probably drawing L3 detail inside an L2.
5. Commit. Renders on GitHub.

## What goes in L2 (container)

- Every deployable unit: web apps, mobile apps, APIs, workers, databases, caches, queues.
- People only on the boundary — show how they enter the system, not how they thread through every internal container.
- External systems from L1 that the containers actually talk to (keep the boundary; remove external systems nothing internal calls).
- Arrows with **direction** and a **short label** describing the interaction (`Calls` with `HTTPS / JSON`, `Enqueues jobs` with `Redis`). The protocol matters — it's half the point of L2.

## What does NOT go in L2

- Classes, functions, modules inside a container — that's L3.
- External systems from L1 if no internal container talks to them — drop them; they clutter the picture.
- Deployment topology (regions, AZs, load balancers) — separate diagram if needed.
- Every single side service (logging, metrics, tracing) — include only if they shape the architecture. Usually a "observability goes to DataDog" note in the accompanying prose is enough.

## Relation to the L1 context diagram

The L2 container diagram is the L1 system "zoomed in" — you should be able to collapse every container back into the single `System(main, ...)` box from the L1 diagram and the external relationships should still match. If they don't, one of the two diagrams is wrong.

## Maintenance

More volatile than L1. Changes when:

- A new container is added (new worker, new mobile app, new cache layer)
- A container is split or merged
- The communication pattern changes (e.g. API direct-reads-DB → API goes through a read replica)

Expect to update this every few releases of significant architectural work. If it's changing every sprint, your architecture is churning faster than it should be.
