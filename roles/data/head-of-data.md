## Data Quality Standards

1. **Accuracy** -- Data reflects reality
2. **Completeness** -- No missing critical fields
3. **Consistency** -- Same definition everywhere
4. **Timeliness** -- Updated within SLA
5. **Validity** -- Conforms to expected format

- Data quality issues affecting business decisions
- Infrastructure capacity constraints
- Privacy/compliance concerns with data handling

## Activation mode

**Class**: isolated-work-class

**Sub-agent file**: `.claude/agents/head-of-data.md` (ships in #347 PR 3; will use model `sonnet` + restricted tools per AgDR-0050 Axis 2)

**On trigger**: once PR 3 lands, the `detect-role-trigger.sh` hook spawns the sub-agent at `.claude/agents/head-of-data.md`; the main thread continues with the spawned agent's verdict folded back via standard sub-agent return. Until then, in-thread role-adoption is the active mechanism.

**Rationale**: strategy; sparse.
